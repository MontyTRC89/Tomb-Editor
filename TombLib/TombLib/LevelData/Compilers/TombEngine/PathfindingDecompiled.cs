     * =============================================================================================
     * TOMBENGINE PATHFINDING SYSTEM - BOX AND OVERLAP GENERATION
     * =============================================================================================
     *
     * OVERVIEW:
     * ---------
     * The pathfinding system divides walkable floor areas into rectangular "boxes".
     * Boxes are connected via "overlaps" which define how enemies can move between them.
     * The game engine uses this pre-computed data for efficient AI navigation.
     *
     * DATA STRUCTURES:
     * ----------------
     * - Box: A rectangular walkable floor region with uniform height
     * - Overlap: A connection between two boxes with movement capability flags
     * - Zone: Groups of boxes reachable by a specific enemy type (computed in Pathfinding.cs)
     *
     * COORDINATE SYSTEM:
     * ------------------
     * TombEditor uses X,Z horizontal coordinates with Z=0 at bottom (increasing upward).
     * Vertical (height) uses Y axis with negative values being higher (TR convention).
     *
     * ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
     * -------------------
     * 1. For each sector in each room, try to create/expand a box (spiral expansion)
     * 2. Deduplicate boxes (same bounds + height + water = same box)
     * 3. For each pair of boxes, check if they overlap/connect
     * 4. Store overlap connections with capability flags (jump, monkey swing)
     * =============================================================================================
