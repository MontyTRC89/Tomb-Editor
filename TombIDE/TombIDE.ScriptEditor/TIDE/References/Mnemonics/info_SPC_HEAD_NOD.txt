Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
This command works like SPC_HEAD_SHAKE command but in this case the head movement will be up/down insteady by left/right.
Moving up/down the head means "yes", "ok", "it's true", "I agree" ect.
Note: really the movement will be not with same angle upstairs and downstairs, since the nod is more with downstairs moving.
Trng will simulate this behavior using the angle supplied for down but only the half of that angle for upper movement.

About syntax of arguments see the description of SPC_HEAD_SHAKE command.
