Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
Adding this flag the movement will be endless and for this reason you'll have to use some flipeffect trigger to stop it (see F177, F178, F179 triggers)

For most directions (DIR_ values) the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag will invert the direction once it has been covered the given distance (typed in Distance field), anyway with some particular DIR_ values, this flag will work in a different way:

With all turning directions (DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90, DIR_TURNING_LEFT_45, DIR_LU_TURNING_180, DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_45, DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_90, DIR_RU_TURNING_180) the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag, it will do continue the same movement with new turnings every linees of distance length. Using different values for turning speed, horizontal speed and distance, you can get that an item drew a circle, an elipse, a rectangle or a square, changing its facing in according with current direction.

With al "head_for" directions (DIR_HEAD_FOR_LARA, DIR_HEAD_FOR_LEADING_ACTOR, DIR_HEAD_FOR_EXTRA_ACTOR) the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag it will continue to follow the given target (Lara, Leading actor or extra actor), updating the direction everytime it had completed the given distance. For instance, mixing the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag with DIR_HEAD_FOR_LARA direction, you get a sort of little robot that will follow lara in any her movement, loosing the contact with her only in the linee of distance length, moving newly head for lara at end of that distance gap.

For all other directions, the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag, will invert direction at end of covered distance.

Note: with all movement having a non constant speed or gravity simulation, the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag will keep the max reached speed o downward gravity with no new acceleration at beginning of new cycle. The only expection is for FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY flag, that will repeat the moving up-down gravity endless, getting the idea of a frog that will continue to jump.
