Used with Customize command

Syntax: Customize= CUST_BACKGROUND, BackGroundType (BKGDT_...), Flags (BKGDF_...), Parameter, ImageId

You can customize the background used for different game phases, using an image from pix folder.

BackGroundType (BKGDT_...) field
---------------------------------
You type in this field the type of background to customize.
See the BKGDT_ values in the reference panel of NG_Center for more infos

Flags (BKGDF_...) field
-----------------------
You can add one or more flags to modify some feature of the chosen background
If you don't wish  use flags you can type IGNORE in this field.

See the BKGDF_ flags in the reference panel of NG_Center for more infos

Parameter field
---------------
This is a field that can have different meanings in according with some flag set in Flags field.
See the BKGDF_ flags in the reference panel of NG_Center for more infos

ImageId field
-------------
You type here the id of the Image= command to use as background.
You should type an Image= command first (above) of the Customize=CUST_BACKGROUND.
It's strongly suggested to use the IF_PRELOAD flag in the Image command, to have a faster displaying in game.

Note: many fields and flags of Image command will be ignored, like those about effects, anyway, in some background types, you can set in the Image command the usage of audio track and the background will use that value as background music.

Example:

Image= 3, 4, IF_PRELOAD+IF_PLAY_AUDIO_TRACK+IF_LOOP_AUDIO_TRACK, IGNORE, 105, IGNORE, IGNORE, IGNORE, IGNORE

Customize= CUST_BACKGROUND, BKGDT_INVENTORY, IGNORE, IGNORE, 3

Above commands will set the "image4.bmp" (from "trle\pix" folder) as new background for inventory/pause/load game/save game, and it will be played the audio track 105 in loop mode.
