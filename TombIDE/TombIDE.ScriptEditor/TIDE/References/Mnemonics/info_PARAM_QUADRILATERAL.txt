Used to store the four vertices to define a quadrilateral to use as fragmented trigger.

Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_QUADRILATERAL, IdParamList, Xa, Ya, Xb, Yb, Xc, Yc, Xd, Yd

A quadrilateral could be a rectangle, a square but also a trapezium or a rhombus.
If it has four sides it is a quadrilateral.

It's not important what is the first point you use as A(x,y) vertex, but it's necessary you type the vertices following the perimeter in clockwise order.

You define a quadrilateral with four 2D vertices.
Each vertex is a point of a game square of 1024x1024 units.
The origin is the top-left corner (north-west corner in planar view in NGLE program)
The X axis moves from 0 (West side of the square) to 1023 (East side of the square)
The Y axis moves from 0 (North side of the square) to 1023 (South side of the square)

IdParamList field
-----------------
You define an univocal id number, different than others Parameters=PARAM_QUADRILATERAL in same [Level] section.
You'll use this number to use these data with the fragmented trigger for quadrilateral

Xa, Ya fields
-------------
Define the A(x,y) vertex

Xb, Yb fields
-------------
Define the B(x,y) vertex

Xc, Yc fields
-------------
Define the C(x,y) vertex

Xd, Yd fields
-------------
Define the D(x,y) vertex
