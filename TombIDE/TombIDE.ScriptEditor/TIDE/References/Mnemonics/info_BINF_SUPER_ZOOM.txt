Used into Customize=CUST_BINOCULARS command
This flag improves the zoom-in factor of binocular.
The max magnifying will pass from 4.2x upto about 40x.
Note that you can omit this flag from script, and enable it using a flipeffect. This method may be useful in game to simulate a change to binocular to improve it thanks to some target reached by lara in game.
This means that it's possible improve binoculars in game, but it's not possible to do the opposite, removing the superzoom once it has been supplied.
