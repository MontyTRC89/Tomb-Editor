If you don't want using a GT_ global trigger to test the condition, but you want use some common CONDITION triggers stored in some TriggerGroup command script, you have to use the value  GT_CONDITION_GROUP for GlobalTrigger field. With this value the engine will check immediatly only the conditions in trigger group you typed in IdConditionGroup field.
Remark: please don't confuse about usage of GT_CONDITION_GROUP value. You cann't add this value to other GT_ global trigger values. This value is used only when you don't want type any specific global trigger but you want to use only conditions of trigger group. Anyway, if you want use a global trigger (like GT_USED_LITTLE_MEDIPACK for example) and you want add also a condition group you can do this simply setting a valid IdTriggerGroup value in IdConditionGroup field.
Pratically the GT_CONDITION_GROUP used only to set a null-doing global trigger with a condition trigger group, because if you put IGNORE in GlobalTrigger field this global trigger will be never performed and the further IdConditionGroup it will be ignored, too.
