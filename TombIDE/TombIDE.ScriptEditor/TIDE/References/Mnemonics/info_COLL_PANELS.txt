Used with Customize=CUST_SET_STILL_COLLISION command.
It enables the still collision when Lara touches some (moveable) PANEL item.

Remarks:

1) The PANEL_... items have been added with the TRNG engine. They are some invisible moveables used only to set specific collision in some side of the rooms.
They have slot enclosed in the range 472 - 479 and names like PANEL_BORDER, PANEL_CORNER ect.

2) The still collisions have some problems when it is necessary decide about sliding/stopping with an item having a diagonal facing (with 45 degrees angle).
These troubles are given by the difficulty to value correctly the diagonal shape of the item, anyway using the specific items: PANEL_DIAGONAL or PANEL_MIDDLE_CORNER, you can enjoy of a specific code to manage in correct way at least these diagonal items. Therefore, if you have troubles with some diagonal item (when lara continues to move legs/arms) you could try to solve the problem in this way:
- Disable the collision for this item
- Place in same position a PANEL_DIAGONAL item to cover same collision position
