Used in Animation command.
This ENV condition works like ENV_FRAME_NUMBER but in this case you can set a valid frame range where the condition will be true.
I suggest to read also the description of ENV_FRAME_NUMBER constant, anyway I remember that these frame checks work when you set in stateid/animation array, one animation number, typed in negative form (for instance: if you wish execute your animation only when lara is performing the animation 32, you'll type "-32" in array of Animation command).
To set the range of frames to get true the ENV condition, you set two numbers of frame range, MaxRange and MinRange, using this formula:

MaxRange * 256 + MinRange

Then you type this value in DistanceForEnv field.

Notes:
* Both limits are enclosed in the valid range for a true condition
* The max value for MaxRange is 254, you cann't pass over it.
