If you set this flag you force engine to set always the first texture of range when the animation will be completed.
Differently, if you omit this flag the last texture showed depends by type of animation.
If you have set no loop, the last texture showed will be the texture of last index of array sequence.
If you have set a loop, the texture showed will depend by the moment when you perform the Stop texture sequence flipeffect.
