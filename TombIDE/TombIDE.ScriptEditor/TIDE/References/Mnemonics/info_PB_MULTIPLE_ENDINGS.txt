Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.
By default Lara will perform always a correct jump, indifferently by the moment when she lets go the bar.
In this way it's not possible to wrong, because the jump is always the same.
If you use the PB_MULTIPLE_ENDINGS flag the situation changes: now lara could wrong the exiting from turning: falling vertically, handlong or in stand-up position.

Remarks:

* This option is not perfect because the state id change should require a correct, specific, next animation to continue the source animation of turning in precise way, frame for frame, while I tried to link source animation with some default animations like that of headlong diving and fast falling (with lara screaming).

* Theorically you could add your new custom animation and link them to animation 462 state id = 128, whereby the change state id editor of wad merger program.
If you create a new animation where lara loses the hanging in a different point of the turn, just you create a change state-id where you set the range of frames for 462 animation where you want that lara can let go the bar. Then you set as state id = 129, and the number of your new animation.
If you perform this attempt it's better don't use the PB_MULTIPLE_ENDINGS value because this flag perform a change of state id in hardcoded mode and this could interfere with your changes of state id.
Technically the code performs this computes:
- When detect that lara lets go the Action key: set as next state id = 129
- This change doesn't happen immediatly but only when the infinite animation 462 find a frame range in state id change correct.
- By default this happens only between frame 8 and 9 of anim 462, and the next animation will be the animation 463
You can add new animation starting from some of intermediate position of rotation, and then apply to specific frame range where lara has that starting position.
