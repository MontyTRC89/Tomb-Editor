Used in SavegamePanel= script command.
By default in the savegame list will be showed the savegame with (old) format:

002  Name of Level       1 days  02:41:11

The game time is “1 days  02:41:11” part. If you use the SPF_NO_TIME_IN_LIST flag the game will be omitted and for this reason the width required to host savegame list will be less.
You could use this flag when the layout requires savegame list in left (or right) half of screen.
