This global trigger permits to verify the distance between Lara and some moveable, when the distance is less than that set in Paramater field the trigger will be engaged.
Reamark: the value to type in Parameter field is a bit complex because it is the combination of two values: the index of moveable to check and the distance (in real units) to compare.

Note: from 1.2.2.4 version the formula is different.

The new formula to use is:

MoveableIndex + (RealUnitDistance * 8192)

For RealUnitDistance we mean the units used in the game, instead using the number of sectors or clicks.
For example, since one sector = 1024, and one click = 256, if you wish check the distance of two sectors the value will be 2048 and you type it in the formula for Parameter in this way:

ItemIndex + 8192 * 2048

Let say the itemindex = 307, the result will be:

307 + 8192*2048 = 16777523

The max value you can use as distance is 130048, that it is 127 sectors.

This distance it will be computed with trigonometric precision as distance between the two 3d points  x,y,z  of Lara and x2,y2,z2 of Item.

Anyway, if you wish ignore the different height (Y coordinates) you can add to the formula the constant value GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT

For example in above example it will become:

130048 + GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT

A possible reason to use the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT mode, is when you wish having a fine precision on whole side of an object, like a column. In this case, if you omit the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT value and therefor the compute enclosed also the Y value, when lara is above of some click respect to the columne she will seem like more far from it because there is yet the distance between the y coordinate of Lara and the Y coordinate of column, on the base of the floor.
Differently, if you use the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT value the distance will be computed only in planar way.
Remark: when you use the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT value you should use also a conditional trigergroup to verify if Lara is in the correct room or in a correct height limit (vertical condition trigger) to avoid that the condition resulted true also when lara is many room over or below the item but only because she is in same x,z position in planar view.
