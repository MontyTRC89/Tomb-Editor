Used in Animation= command.
This is a very original condition. Pratically it verifies from how much time are missing keyboard commands.
You have to type in DistanceForEnv the number of tickframes (one second= 30 tickframes) required to enable this condition.
For example if you want have true this condition when the player doesn't perform game commands from 3 seconds, you have to type in DistanceForEnv field the value 90 (because 3 * 30 = 90)
This condition could be used to start nice animation in stand-by mode, i.e. when the player is not playing activly (no keyboard signals) you can show an animation where lara scratches one's head, or she turns her face to look player saying: "Are you sleeping?"
If you mean use this nice animation in standby you should remember to set in this animation a state id different by standard state-ids, for example you can use the state id STATE_CONTROLLED, to avoid that some new game command cause a bad change between current (custom animation) and new standard animation.
When you use the state id neutral no new animation will be performed until lara comes back to some standard state id.
So you could create an animation with state id = STATE_CONTROLLED and as next animation the defaul animation of still stand-up.
You'll have to create a custom animation where lara starts from stand-up position, it performs the nice move, and then comes back to stand-up animation, with the next animation having the standard stand-up animation.
