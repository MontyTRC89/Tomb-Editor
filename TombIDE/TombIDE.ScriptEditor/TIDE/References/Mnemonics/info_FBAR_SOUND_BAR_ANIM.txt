Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command. This flag creates in current bar a floating colors like you see in audio bar in Options screen.
When you use this flag you can also type in Extra field an IdColor (pointing to some ColorRGB= command) to set the mask color.
The audio bar works in particular way: there is a floating effect using two colors, the MainColor (IdColor1) and the background color (IdColor2), while the mask color will be used to paint the full side of bar.
For example if you use this flag with BAR_HEALTH and lara has 50 % of HP, the left half of bar will be colored with MaskColor to differentiate by right (empty) half.
The mask color doesn't paint fully the bar but it will be added to current floating effect.
For example if you set as MaskColor the rgb, with 0,0,0 values, you'll get no difference between left side and right side of bar because adding the 0,0,0, nothing change.
While if you set like mask color the white, with rgb values 255,255,255, the full side of bar will become fully white, losing the floating effect.
For above reasons it is a bit complicated set a good maskcolor. You should try a mask color where the rgb value was not 0 but neither 255. For example a color like: 128,128,128 (this is the default mask color if you type IGNORE in extra field), or  63,63,63  (it used in tomb4 for audio bar in some circustances)
