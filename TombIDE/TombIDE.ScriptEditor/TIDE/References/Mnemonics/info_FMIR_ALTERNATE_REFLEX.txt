Used in MirrorEffect command
This flag may be added to the index of an animating when in a first attempt you remained displeased about its reflex.
The technical explanation is that there are two different ways to simulate the reflex of an item. If first method (less FMIR_ALTERNATE_REFLEX) is bad, you can add the FMIR_ALTERNATE_REFLEX, rebuild the script to see if now it's better.
Like general rule the animating with a good reflex had at least two opposite sides that are specular between them.
