New trng ocb values
-------------------
From 1.2.2.3 version, you can type in Switch1/2/3 objects an animation number. This animation will be performed when lara is engaging the switch. 
The correct range for animation number is: 4 / 4095 

When you use this  custom trng animation feature, you can also add one or following flags to animation number:

8192 (Flip/Flop switch)
------------------------
When you add 8192 to the animation number, you enable the flip/flop (or on/off) feature, where lara will be able to active/disactive more times the switch.
In this situation you have to create two custom animations in two closed animation slots and then type the number of first animation.
For example if your custom animation to engage (first time) the switch is the number 386, you should type 8192 + 386 as OCB, and you should create also the inverse animation (for the antitriggering of the switch) to place in animation slot number 387, i.e. the following to 386.

Remark: not all switches allow the flip/flop feature.
A switch, to have flip/flop features, should have always four animations.
They, usually, will have following data:

Anim  StateId NextAnim  Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 0      0        0      Still, beginning position
 1      2        2      Moving from beginning pos. to ending pos.
 2      1        2      Still, ending position
 3      2        0      Moving from ending pos. to begning pos.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tip: you can find some correct switch in a slot different than Switch type 1/2/3 slot, like the JUMP SWITCH, and then copy this object renaming it to move it in a switch type 1/2/3 slot. For example in Guardian of Semherket wad you find a good flip/flop switch in the JUMP SWITCH slot.

4096 (Opposite state ids)
-------------------------
Looking the above animation table, and comparing it with other switches you could discover that the stateids are differents, in particular when the state id of beginning position is "1" (instead "0") and that of ending position is "0" (instead "1").
In this case you have to add to the switch ocb also the flag 4096 to inform the trng engine about this inversion of state ids.

Remark: you have to use this flag also when you don't use the flip/flop feature. You should use this flag everytime the beginning position (or "off" state) is "1" instead by "0"

Remark: the anitrigger feature, in flip/flop switches, works fine with common triggers to enable doors or flipmaps, but it cann't work byself for special trng trigger, like actions to move or change in some manner a moveable. In this case it's necessary that you create a triggergroup where it will be checked the current state id of the switch object and, in according with this value, it will be performed different triggers, for positive (triggering) action or antitriggering mode. 
Then you'll perform only this triggergroup in the switch sector.

Standard (old) ocbs for switch 1/2/3
------------------------------------
0 = Animation where lara pull up a little switch
1 = to make this a "reach in the hole" to find a pick-up. (*)
2 = to make this a "reach in hole, open a door" switch
3 = to make Lara do the "push wall switch animation".
-1 = Animation where lara reachs in the low hole a pickup. Before pickuping up the item, lara will look in the hole. (different animation but same target of ocb 1.)
(*) You must set same OCB code ( = 1) also in item in the hole
