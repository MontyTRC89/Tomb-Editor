Really the ocb to set in TEETH_SPIKES are the same of old engine, anyway if you want enable teeth_spikes type tomb raider 1 where Lara is able to across if she moves slowly, you have to insert the OCB = 20.
Ocb 20 means: spikes point to north and static spikes

Then you have to add this line in your script.txt file in [Level] section:

Enemy= TEETH_SPIKES, IGNORE, IGNORE, IGNORE, EXTRA_TEETH_NO_DAMAGE_ON_WALKING

The EXTRA_TEETH_NO_DAMAGE_ON_WALKING flag means: the teeth spikes will work like TR1 spikes.
