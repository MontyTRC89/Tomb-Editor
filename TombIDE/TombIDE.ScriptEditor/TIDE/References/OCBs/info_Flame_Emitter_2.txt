Note: The flame emitter 2 will not cause death of Lara

2 = to make the flame move along in the direction the cone is pointing.
Remark: this "moving" is not simply the direction of the flames, but the fire moves really its position in the room upto a disappear behind some wall of the room. To avoid to have a resource like a fire continuously enabled it's advisable set the direction of fire to move it upto a water room. When this fire reaches a water room it will disappear with a volumetric effect.

123 = Fire with standard size, i.e. the same size of flame emitter 1

{Positive numbers different than 2 and 123}: the ocb gives the height  of flames. Bigger are the ocb values and littler will be the flames. For this reason an ocb 1 will have a flame bigger than ocb = 50.

{Negative numbers} = Curiosly, the negative OCB numbers enable the flipmap corresponding to negative number of the ocb. For example if you set -1, the flimap 1 will be enabled. In this situation no fire will be drawn.
