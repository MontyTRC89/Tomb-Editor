The ocb is a color in compact format, where each gradient (red, green, blue) has only 5 bits.
The first 5 bits (with lower value) are the red, then it comes the geen, and at end with higher values the blue.

Some example:

31  = Full red
992 = Full green
31744 = Full Blue

The adding some of above values (or using others with less intensity) you can get other colors.
For example:

31 + 992 = (red + green) = 1023 = yellow
