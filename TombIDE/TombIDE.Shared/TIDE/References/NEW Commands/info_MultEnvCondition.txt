Syntax: MultEnvCondition=IdMultCondition, ENV_ condition, DistanceForEnv, Extra field, array of tripled of {ENV_ Condition, DistanceForEnv, Extra field}
Scope: to use in [Level] section
Max number of instances for level section: 255

This command used only to store mutiple ENV_ (environment) condition for Animation script command.
When you want set two or more ENV conditions for your Animation command, you have to create a MultEnvCondition command with all ENV condition you wish, and then set the Id of current MultEnvCondition in field "Distance for env" of Animation command, while in field "Env Condition" of Animation command you'll type the value ENV_MULT_CONDITION to inform that the real condition have stored in MultEnvCondition command with Id = Distance for env of Animation command.

IdMultCondition field
---------------------
In this field you type simply a progressive number to identify this command. The you'll use same number in "Distance for env" field of Animation command to link it with Animation command.

Note: the valid range for IdMultCondition field is 1/2559 anyway, when you call it directly from a trigger in the level, the max valid ID is 1023

ENV_ condition field
--------------------
This field work in same way of "Env Condition" field of Animation command.
You type in this field an ENV_ condition value + (optionally) some ENV_POS_ flags.

See description of "Env condition field" in Animation command chapter for more infos.

Distance for env field
----------------------
This field work in same way of "Distance for Env" field of Animation command.
You type in this field a value to set the distance about current (previous) ENV_ condition.

See description of "Distance for Env field" in Animation command chapter for more infos.

Extra field
-----------
This field has same usage of ExtraSlot of animation command.
If you use an ENV condition requiring a value in ExtraSlot field, you can type this value in Extra field.


array of triples of {ENV_ Condition, DistanceForEnv, Extra} fields
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You can type many triples of fields "EnvCondition","DistanceForEnv", "Extra" until to a max of 125 couples.


Examples:

If you want set in your animation command two Env condition, like: ENV_CEILING_HEIGHT with height (distance env) = $300 (3 clicks) + other condition: ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT with depth (distance env) = $400 (4 clicks) you can as first step create this MultEnvCondition command:

MultEnvCondition= 1, ENV_CEILING_HEIGHT, $300, IGNORE,  ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT, $400, IGNORE

and then type in Animation command the reference for Id of above MultEnvCondition (1) and the ENV_ condition: ENV_MULT_CONDITION

For example:

Animation=447, KEY1_LEFT, IGNORE,IGNORE,ENV_MULT_CONDITION, 1,IGNORE,-445, -448
