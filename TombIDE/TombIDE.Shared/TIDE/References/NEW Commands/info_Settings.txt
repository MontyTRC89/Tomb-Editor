Syntax: Settings= SET_ constants
Scope: To use in [Options] section

This command will be placed in [Options] section to set some gloal settings.

Arguments:

SET_ constants field
You can type one or more SET_ values separated by plus (+) sign.
Currently there are followin SET_ constants:

SET_DISABLE_CHEATS
Disable all hidden cheats to skip level, get infinite weapons or items.
Remark: to disable flycheat you have to use old command FlyCheat = DISABLED 

SET_BLIND_SAVEGAMES
If you want forbid players of your game to use savegame editor to change savegames, just you add this flag in Settings command.
Any attempt of players to modify savegames will cause immediate crash at reload.

SET_CRYPT_SCRIPT
Setting this flag the script.dat file will be crypted to forbid decompilation with some utilities.
If you set some security issues, like SET_DISABLE_CHEATS, it's advisable set also crypting of script.dat, otherwise some guy could simply decompile the script.dat and recompile it removing the SET_DISABLE_CHEATS flag.

SET_PERFORM_FROM_CD 
With this constant your game will be able to be performed from CD / DVD and generally from only-read storage support.
Pratically the reason to use this setting is when you want give your game to some friend, stored on cd and playable directly from CD with no need of installation of level editor (TRLE) folder on local disk.
When this setting is present the trng engine will save and load savegame not from current TRLE folder where is has been store, but in/from new folder in local drive C: with same name of first level description different by title.
For example if you use this option with a level described in script.txt like "City Of The Dead", trng will create a folder named:

C:\City_Of_The_Dead

and it will save and load savegames in/from this folder.

Remark:
If you want create an autostart CD in this way, you have to perform following steps:

1) Add in script.txt file in [Options] section the command:

Settings = SET_PERFORM_FROM_CD 

(You can also add other SET_ flag to above line, of course)

2) Build script.txt

3) When you have in TRLE folder all level files (.dat , .tr4
) necessary to play your game, you can save whole TRLE folder, including also the name of TRLE folder, in CD image to burn on cd support.

4) Before burning image you should add to image also following files, you find in Extra_NG_File.zip:

START.exe
autorun.inf


5) Now you can burn the CD and, at end, you should get following list browsing the new created CD:

START.exe
autorun.info
TRLE   (Folder)

Remark: the start.exe and autorun.inf files should be in root of CD, i.e. outside of TRLE folder

6) Now just inserting this cd in some CD reader and the game will be started and played byself, without need of installation on local disk (of target computer) of TRLE or other files or programs.
