Syntax: FogRange=StartLimitDistanceFog, EndLimitDistanceFog
Scope: To use in [Level] section

Default values in tomb4:
StartLimitDistanceFog = 12 sectors
EndLimitDistanceFog = 20 sectors (or LevelFarView)

With FogRange= command you can change the limits for distance fog changing position and density of this fog.
Remark: the distance fog is visible only when VolumetricFx is disabled.

StartLimitDistanceFog field
----------------------------
The StartLimitDistanceFog value is the number of sectors from what the fog will be visibile. It used only for distance fog, i.e. the fog you get when VolumetricFx is disabled.

To increase the effect of fog you should type in this field negative numbers. Bigger is the absolute value you type and stronger is the fog density.

Remark: In spite of above speech it's not sure it's good using negative values because in this way you get also an abnormal intensity of fog color in transparent texture of level (like water) or objects (transparent or shining textures.
Pheraps in some circustances it's better reduce the EndLimitDistanceFog field when you want a distance fog with high density. In this case you can let the StartLimitDistanceFog field to 0, avoiding negative values.


EndLimitDistanceFog field
--------------------------
This value is usually set with same value of WorldFarView (or LevelFarView) anyway, if you want a very depth fog, you can reduce this value and this value will be the number of sectors where lara will be able too see.
The formula of fog distance works (about) in this way:
It begins a fog effect from StartLimitDistanceFog sector from Lara (really from the cam) and this fog effect increases its density upto reach the 100% density to  EndLimitDistanceFog sectors distance.
So if you set a very big EndLimitDistanceFog value the fog will be alwasy very light and you'll be able to see also the most far distance, while if you set a short value in EndLimitDistanceFog you'll see only upto the EndLimitDistanceFog sector distance.
