Syntax: ItemGroup=IdGroup, FirstIndexItem, Other indices for items
Scope: To Use in [Level] section
Max number of instances for level section: 99

ItemGroup permits to store a group of moveable or static indices, you get these indices from NGLE, when you click on some object you see its index showed as first number if a yellow box.
Remark: when you create a group of static indices you have to type the indices as negative numbers. For example if you wish create a group with static items with indices 12,43,55,56 you'll have to type them like: -12,-43,-55,-56

Once you set a list of items in some ItemGroup, you'll be able to perform some operations on all objects referenced by ItemGroup, with a single trigger (Flipeffects starting with description: "ItemGroup. ....")

The advantage to work with ItemGroup are two:

1) You can use many items like it was a single item, for example moving (or enabling, or rotating, or hiding) all items in same moment with a single trigger.
2) To perform some particular operation with doors or enemies sequence about activation.
See specific flipeffect triggers starting with "ItemGroup. " descriptive text.
