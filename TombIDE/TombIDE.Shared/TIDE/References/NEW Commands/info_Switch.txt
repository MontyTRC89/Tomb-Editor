Syntax: Switch= SwitchId, VariablePlaceFolder, FlagsSwitch (SWT_....), Trigger Group Indices
Scope: To use in [Level] section.
Max number of instances for level section: 127

Introduction
------------
The Switch command permits to choose between a list of TriggerGroup indices in according with the value in a variabile.
In this way you can for example, ask a number to player with KeyPad and then perform different trigger group in according with the number chose by the player.
Remark: theorically you could get same result with a triggergroup filled with a long list of condition trigger and ELSE tgroup_ flags, but using the switch you can realize this target in easier and faster way,

SwitchId field
--------------
This is the ID you can choose in the flipeffect to perform a Switch command.
You have to type different progressive numbers for the IDs in same [Level] section.
Valid range for IDs: 1 / 1279

VariablePlaceFolder field
-------------------------
In this field you type the Place Folder to identify a specific TRNG Variable.
You can see the full list of Place Folders in [Reference] panel of NG_Center program, in the section named: "VARIABLE PLACEFOLDERS".
For example if you want use the variable "Local Short Beta1" you'll type the placefolder: #0052

Remark: if you type IGNORE in this field the Switch will use the variable "Last Input Number", since it is the variable that receives the value typed with KeyPad object.

FlagsSwitch (SWT_....) field
----------------------------
In this field you can type one or more SWT_ constants to affect the working mode of Switch command.
If you don't wish using flags you can type IGNORE in this field.
See the list of SWT_ constants in [Reference] panel of NG_Center program.

Trigger Group Indices fields
----------------------------
From this field you can type indices of TriggerGroup commands.
The first triggergroup will be performed when the variable will be "1", the second when it will be "2", ect.
If you type IGNORE in some field this means there will be no triggergroup for that number.
For example if you don't want perform any triggergroup when the variabile is "2" you can type a list like this:
 ..., 4, IGNORE, 7, 8
In this way when te variable will "1" it will be performed the TriggerGroup=4.
When the variable is "2" nothing will be performed.
When the variable is "3" will be performed the TriggerGroup=7
and when the variable is "4" will be performed the TriggerGroup=8

You can place upto 120 indices in this array.
