The AnimationSlot is very alike than Animation command with the difference that the AnimationSlot works on moveable different of Lara.
You can use it to create from zero a new moveable or vehicle, or to change the animations of some already existing moveable.

The most of fields and flags of AnimationSlot are the same of Animation command, therefore here it will be described only the difference between the two commands. While, to get infos about the common fields, read the description of Animation command.

Slot field
----------
In this field you type the slot number or mnemonic constant (BADDY_1, MUMMY) of the slot you mean change.

AnimSlotFlags (ASF_...) field
------------------------------
In this field you can type one or more ASF_ flags to affect AnimationSlot command.
 
Other fields (common to Animation command)
------------------------------------------
All fields following the (above) ActionType field, are the same of Animation command, so read the description of Animation command to have infos about those fields.
Here I'll do only a short briefing about the difference between the two commands.

(1) Since the AnimationSlot works on a specific (different by Lara) slot the animation numbers and state-ids in the final State_id, AnimIndex array, will regard the anim and state ids of that slot.

(2) Execpt for the Vehicles, the Key1 and Key2 fields are unused in AnimationSlot, since it is not the player to control the enemies.

(3) When you are building a vehicle you have to work on two different slots: the slot of the vehicle, and the slot with the lara's animation used for that vehicle.
Since lara and the vehicle will have always the same animation number in the same moment (until lara is driving it), it's not a problem set in the AnimIndex field the animation number, anyway it's not the same thing type in the Slot field (the first field of the AnimationSlot command) the vehcile slot or the Lara's anim slot, because the condition about environment and distance will regard one or the other moveable in according with this choice. For this reason, usually, you'll set the vehicle slot for animtype about the moving of the vehicle, since it has a bigger collision box and it's this collision box the most important, while you'll use the Lara's anim slot to compute other particular situations like the further injury of lara from enemies.
Remark: when you set a condition for the lara's anims the effective object that it will be used, it will be own lara, with the only differences about the animations used that they will be those of the specific lara's anim slot.

(4) When you use the env condition: ENV_CONDITION_TRIGGER_GROUP flag, the actions and conditions triggers stored in that triggergroup can be redirect to work on our enemy, vehicle, or Lara's anim slot, using one of following trigger group flags:

TGROUP_USE_ITEM_USED_BY_LARA_INDEX  This is the vehicle driven by Lara
TGROUP_USE_EXECUTOR_ITEM_INDEX  This is the index of Lara while she is driving, or it's the index of the enemy you are changing/creating with the AnimationSlot command
TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX (this is, as usual, the further item that has been found  with a testposition condition in the AnimationSlot command).
