Syntax: NewSoundEngine=ENABLED/DISABLED
Scope: To use in [Option] section

The new sound engine should be the BASS 2.4 sound library created by Un4seen Developments Ltd.
This new engine is based on Bass.dll and it permits to have two channels for CD audio sound  (backgroup and foreground or channel1 and channel2) in same time.
Other features supported are:
- Play sound file different than .wav like .mp3 or .ogg files
- Fade out effect to close sweetly the previous sound before starting another cd track
- Dynamic change of frequency or volume in game wherey new flipeffect triggers.

ENABLED/DISABLED field
----------------------
By default the new sound engine is enabled, this means that, if you don't type any NewSoundEngine command in your script.dat, the new sound engine will be used.
For this reason you should use this command only if you want disable it with the command:

NewSoundEngine=DISABLED

Remarks:

* It's not necessary change the sound format when you use the new sound engine. The bass.dll is able to support the common ADPCM wav files you find in AUDIO folder.
* It's not advisable to add to your level file the bass.dll library, because TRNG uses a build-in bass.dll library and another bass.dll library could create conflicts other the fact it could be a wrong version number. (The bass.dll used by tomb_nextgeneration.dll is the version 2.4.0.1, and it's better to let this version of bass.dll)
The internal bass.dll library will be extracted at-fly when tomb4 will be started.
