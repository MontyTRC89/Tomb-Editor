Syntax: Turbo=Flags (TRB_..), FPStoKeep
Scope: To use in [Level] section

Turbo command allows to set some tricks to enahance the speed of game engine. 
You should use this command only when your level has some problem of frame rate, i.e. when the FPS goes under 29 FPS.

Remark: At bottom of description for Turbo command, you find some suggestion to enhance the speed of your level using some little tricks in projection phase.

Description of fields:

Flags (TRB_..) field
---------------------
You can set one or more (linking with +) TRB_ constant values
To have a description of TRB_ values read the infos about each TRB_ value you can find in Reference Panel of NG Center program, in section "MNEMONIC CONSTANTS..".

FPStoKeep field
----------------
This field used ONLY if you set also TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW setting in Flags field.
You should type the FPS value you want keep.
If you type IGNORE the default value is 29 FPS and this means that, when FPS goes belove 29 fps TRNG will reduce far view distance until to reach newly 29 fps.
If your level in some side has very low fps, for example 15 fps, it's better don't require a too high FPStoKeep value, otherwise the distance will be decreased too much. For example if you type 20 like fps to keep, trng will begin to reduce distance far view only when fps goes down 20 fps.
Pratically this field is a way to answer to following question: How much is it important for me the best frame rate, and how much the max far view distance?
If you retain very very important to have always best frame rate, you type 29 (the max value) and the game will keep always this frame rate also damaing severly the far view distance. Differently, if you thinks it's very important the far view distance, then you could type in thsi field only a low value like 20 fps, in this way the far distance will be preserved almost always, with only exception when the game is really very down about frame rate.

Remark: if you don't use the TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW setting you have to type IGNORE in this field.

Some tips to enhance the speed of your level
--------------------------------------------
If the usage of Turbo command is not yet enough to get the wished result, you could use some little tricks while you are building your level to enahnce the speed.

The problem of statics...
--------------------------
The static objects require many more time to be showed than moveable objects. For this reason many "slow down" problem born own because there are too much statics in same room or nearby.
To solve this problem a trick is to replace the static objects with moveable object with same look.
For example you can replace your static copying its meshes and textures with strpix program.
Using "Export dxf" on original static object, and the command "Import dxf" while you are placed on some moveable, like an Animating, in this way also the correct textures will be moved fine.

The transparence problem...
---------------------------
For complex reason the game engine perform many extra computes when some object has transparent textures. Hence it's not possible always giving up about this usage, in some circustances you could replace the transparent texture with some more detailed opaque mesh.
For example to simulate a cirle, instead using a squared mesh with a transparent texture where the circle is the opaque side, you could creare a real circular mesh using some triangles. In this way you'll have avoied the usage of transparent texture without giving up the shape you wished.

An alternative to Adapative frame rate setting
----------------------------------------------
If you are not satisfacted by working of Adapative frame rate of Turbo command, you can set in your level some specific 
zones where have a reduced far view and other with bigger far view, using new flipeffect triggers to set dynamically the current level far view value.
Using this method you should disable the adaptive far view in turbo command otherwise there will be conflicts, and the you should to study your level in game to understand what are the zone where it's important to have a gain in fps reducing the level far view.
For example if your level there is a wook with many trees very closed it's very problem you'll have some problem of speed, in this case you could place a strip of trigger to enable reduced far view when lara enters in this wood, while another bound of triggers to set a bigger far view when lara goes out from this wood.
