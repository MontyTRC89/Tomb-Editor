Syntax: PreserveInventory= ENABLED
Scope: to use in [Level] section

PreserveInventory command may be used when you use a ResetHUB= command in same [Level] section.
With ResetHUB command you set the level number that will be started from current level with some FINISH trigger.
If  you want reload lara's meshes (or change vheicle) you have to use ResetHUB. Ok, this is about old ResetHub command.
The problem with ResetHUB is the pickup items will be cleared from ResetHUB command.
If you want to use a ResetHUB and, in same time, to preserve the pick up items picked up in previous levels just you add in [Level] section the command:

PreserveInventory=ENABLED
