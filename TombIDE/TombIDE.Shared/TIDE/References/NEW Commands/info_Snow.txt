Syntax: Snow= SNOW_ constant
Scope: To use in [Level] section

The snow will be showed in current level only if in current [Level] section is present the command "Snow=SNOW_SINGLE_ROOM"  or "Snow=SNOW_ALL_OUTSIDE"

SNOW_DISABLED
This settings is the same to omit to insert Snow= command. The futher rooms labeled as "Snow" room in ngle will be ignored, i.e. no snow effect will be showed.

SNOW_SINGLE_ROOM
Only the room with "Snow" label in ngle and with [O] (outside) status will have the snow in game.
Each room will have own snow intensity read from field Water Intensity at right of multistate button Water/Rain/Snow ...

SNOW_ALL_OUTSIDE
The snow will be showed in all outside room, ignoring multistate button. This means that also a room without "snow" button will have the snow if it is different than Water room and it has the [O] outside status.

Remarks:
(1) If you use SNOW_ALL_OUTSIDE setting, and you want set the intensity for snow in all level, you can set a single room with "Snow" attribute in ngle and set in that room in water intensity field the value for snow intensity. That value will be used for whole level.

(2) If you don't mean to use snow rooms in current level it's better use command "Snow=SNOW_DISABLED" to inform trng engine to avoid a lot of computes to locate further snow rooms.
