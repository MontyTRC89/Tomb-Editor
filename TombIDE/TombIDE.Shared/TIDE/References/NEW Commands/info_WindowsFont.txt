Syntax: WindowsFont= IdWindowFont, WindowFontName, WindowsFontFlags (WFF_...), SizeFont, ColorRbgId, ShadowColorRgbId
Scope: To use in [Level] section
Max number of instances for level section: 99

WindowsFont permits to choose the settings for Windows Font.
Please, don't confuse the common game font used in Tomb Raider with Windows Font.
The Windows Fonts can be used only in special trng page layout, like Lara's Diary and other trng features that will be added in feature.

IdWindowFont field
------------------
In this field you type a progressive number used as identifier to reference this font setting from other script commands.
Valid range for IDs: 1 / 999

WindowFontName field
--------------------
You can type a standard font name.
Note: from the 1.2.2.7 trng version, you can introduce the font name with the charset code for the font.
You use the colon character ":" to linke the two sides.
Example:

204:Arial

The list of most important charset codes:

ANSI_CHARSET            0
DEFAULT_CHARSET         1
SYMBOL_CHARSET          2
SHIFTJIS_CHARSET        128
HANGEUL_CHARSET         129
GB2312_CHARSET          134
CHINESEBIG5_CHARSET     136
OEM_CHARSET             255
JOHAB_CHARSET           130
HEBREW_CHARSET          177
ARABIC_CHARSET          178
GREEK_CHARSET           161
TURKISH_CHARSET         162
VIETNAMESE_CHARSET      163
THAI_CHARSET            222
EASTEUROPE_CHARSET      238
RUSSIAN_CHARSET         204
BALTIC_CHARSET          186

Note: if we wish having western charset just omit the charset number and the value used by default will be 0, i.e. ANSI charset that is good for all western europe languages (english, german, french, spanish, italian)

Remark: currently trng engine supports only 8 bit encoding charset. Therefor you can not use unicode or other 16 bit charset.

About the font name, altough there were a lot of Windows fonts, I suggest to use only very common font names, otherwise there is the risk that the font you chose was missing in some player's computer.
The most common font names are:

Arial
Comic Sans MS
Courier
Courier New
Ms Sans Serif
Times New Roman
Verdana

Remark: the name you type in this field, it's necessary type also in strings section, like it happens for script command like Puzzle or Legend
For example if you use "Courier New" you'll type this text in this field:

WindowsFont= 1, Courier New, ...

And then you have to type this text also in [Strings] or [ExtraNG] strings section.

Note: when you set a charset number, also this number should be typed in the string. For example if you use in the windowsfont the composite font name "128:MS Gothic", you'll have to type this composite name also in the string section “128:MS Gothic”

Remark: If you omit the font name, typing IGNORE, trng will find a generic font responding to other settings, like bold and size.
Anyway to get best results it's better type always a font name.



WindowsFontFlags (WFF_...) field
---------------------------------
In this field you can type one or more WFF_ flags linked with "+" sign.
If you type IGNORE in this field trng will use default setting: WFF_BOLD+WFF_SHADOW+WFF_LEFT_ALIGN for common text settings, while for title settings will use: WFF_CENTER_ALIGN+WFF_UNDERLINE+WFF_ULTRA_BOLD

See description of WFF_ flags in Reference panel of NG_Center program.

SizeFont field
--------------
The size of fonts is computed in complicated method.
This value is the height in pixels of bigger character in a screen resolution 1024 x 768, where the width of the char is the 50 % of SizeFont you typed.
Then, this size will be stretched in according with current effective resolution of game screen.

Remark: About the space that will be necessary to host the text on the screen it's important advise that this size could be a bit different when the game work with different screen resolution, for this reason it's important you set a couple of [Size Font] and [Frame Size for text] to have some free space yet available in frame text, to compensate further adjustment.
Said in other way: if you chose a big size for your font and you are happy because all text fits in the text frame you chose, you could have a bad surprise when the game will be played on other PC or in other different resolution, because the same text could be too long to be fit in that text frame and the player could be not able to read last rows of your text. 
So, to avoid this risk, it's better let a safety extra space in your text frame to compensate these variations in font size between different computers and resolutions.

Theorically you should let empty about a 25/30 % of whole space to compensate above variations.


ColorRbgId and ShadowColorRgbId
 fields
---------------------------------------
With these two fields you can set the color for font (
ColorRbgId) and for further shadow color (ShadowColorRgbId
)
The value you type is the identifier of some ColorRGB in same [Level] section.
You should choose for shadow color a very different color respect than text color.  For example, if the text color is white, you should choose black for shadow, and vice-versa.

Remark: it's necessary that the ColorRGB commands were typed BEFORE of WindowsFont command that uses them, otherwise in the parsing phase trng will be not able to locate the correct ColorRGB command because it has not yet been parsed.
