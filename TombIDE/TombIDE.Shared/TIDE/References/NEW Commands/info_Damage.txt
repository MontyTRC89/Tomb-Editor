Damage command allow you to customize appareance and behavior of damage feature in damage rooms and cold water rooms in game.
Remark: you can also don't use any Damage command in script.txt and damage rooms and cold water rooms will work fine but using default settings (see belove)

Arguments:

FlagsDMG_ = One or more constant values to set behavior of damage. You can find the list of DMG flags in Reference panel of NG_Center.
You can add different DMG_ values using plus '+' sign to sum them.
Currently are present following DMG flags:

DMG_INDIRECT_BAR  
Enable progress bar for indirect damage.
When this flag is present the damage work in this way: the damage bar decrease but, until it's not empyt, there is no damage for Lara.
When the damage bar is empty, start to decrease HP (vitality) of Lara in very fast way.
Differently, if you don't set this flag the damage will effect directly the HP bar of lara.

DMG_ONLY_PAD
Restrict the damage only when lara is touching floor of current damage room. For this reason this flag will be ignored in cold water rooms.
You can use this flag to simulate a burning/electric floor in some room.

DMG_INCREASE_BAR
To use only with DMG_INDIRECT_BAR flag.
By default the damage bar starts full and decrease with the time, while using this flag you force the damage bar to start empty and increase while time elapses.
You can use this flag to simulate an increment of temperature in current room.

DMG_COLD_WATER
You can set this flag to customize Cold Water room feature.
If you don't use this flag, the setting will effect damage rooms.

DMG_POISON_LARA
Setting this flag you force a poisoning of Lara not yet she enter in damage rooms.

DMG_BURNING_DEATH
To use only for damage rooms waterless.
If this flag is enabled, lara will burns when:
The indirect bar is empty (if indirect bar is present)
The HP bar is empty  (if you don't enabled indirect bar for damage room)
You could use this flag to simulate a room where the temperature grows until burning lara.

DMG_BURNING_SCREAM
To use only with DMG_BURNING_DEATH flag.
If you set the DMG_BURNING_DEATH flag you can set also this flag to force lara to scream when she takes fire.
Remark: this flag works only with indirect bar, because when indirect bar is not set, lara burns and dies immediatly and so she has no time to scream.

DMG_SLOW_DISAPPEARING
To use only with  DMG_INDIRECT_BAR flag.
With this flag, when Lara goes off from damage/cold water room the bar will increase slowly until it's full, and only in this moment it will be removed from screen.
Differently, if you don't set this flag, the indirect bar will disappear immediatly not just Lara exits from damage room.

DMG_ALERT_BEEP
To use only with DMG_INDIRECT_BAR  flag.
If you set this flag, when the bar will be go down until 15 % (or less) than full value, the bar will blink and a little "beep" sound will be performed togheter with blinking.
Remark: Also when this flag is absent the bar will blink but no sound will be performed.

SecondsForDeath = Damage procedure use seconds as misure unit for damage and speed of bar. Pratically the number you set in this field is the number of seconds necessary to decrease fully whole bar. So, if you set a big number (for example 40 seconds) the damage is very tiny because it will be necessary many time to kill lara or to decrease whole bar. Differently, if you set a little number of seconds the damage will be very strong and lara will be killed in fast time.

SecondsForBarRestore = This field works like above field (SecondsForDeath) but in this case it controls the speed to restore fully bar when Lara goes off from cold water or damage room.

BarColor = In this field you type a RGB value to set main color of bar.
The rgb value in hexadecimal format (use '$' prefix for hexadecimal values) is: $RRGGBB  
Where: RR = Red, GG=Green and BB=Blue intensity.
Some possible values are:

$f924f1  Pink (default color for cold water rooms)
$F6F923  Yellow (default color for damage rooms)
$fb8953  Orange
$FF0000  Red
$00FF00  Green
$0000FF  Blue

BarName = If you wish you can set in this field a string to describe the bar in game.
For example if you type in this field the string "Temperature",  this text will be showed in game at bottom of damage bar.
Remark:
It's necessary that the text you type in this field is present in english.txt file, in standard strings or in extrang strings sections.
A way to around this limitation is to type directly the index value of string instead to type the real text.
To know indices of strings you can use Strings panel of NG Cener program.
The index must be typed in following way:

#12    For standard string with index = 12 present in [Strings] section
!12    For extra ng string with index = 12 present in [ExtraNG] section

If you use index of string is not necessary that the string was present also in english.txt but just it is present in specific language.dat file you'll use in game.

Remark: if you don't want show a name for bar you can type in this file "IGNORE" or null sign for strings * (asterisk).

BlinkPercentage field
You can set from what percentage the bar will start to blink.
For example if you set 30 as BlinkPercentage, the bar will blinks when it 30 % or less than full bar.
If you type IGNORE in this field, it will be used the default value is 20%
Default values:
If you don't set a Damage command in script for current level the settings will be the following.

For generic damage rooms:

Damage=DMG_INDIRECT_BAR + DMG_SLOW_DISAPPEARING + DMG_ALERT_BEEP, 16, 6, $F6F923, IGNORE

For cold water rooms:

Damage=DMG_INDIRECT_BAR + DMG_SLOW_DISAPPEARING + DMG_ALERT_BEEP, 10, 5, $f924f1, IGNORE
