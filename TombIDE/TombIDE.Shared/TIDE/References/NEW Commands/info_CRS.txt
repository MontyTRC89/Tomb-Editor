Syntax: CRS=ENABLED/DISABLED
Scope: To use in [Options] section

CRS means Crash Resume System, it works in same way of CRS settings of NGLE program.
When CRS is enabled is very improbable the game was stopped by crash.

My suggestion about usage of CRS is to disable CRS (CRS=DISABLED) while you are building  your level (because it's better to know if somewhat doensn't work), while to enable CRS only before developing your final release on the net to avoid further crashes at players.

Remarks:
(1) When CRS is disabled if a crash occurs a file named Last_Crash#.txt will be created in current TRLE folder. 
Another little file (always the same) will be showed non just the game has been closed, to inform you it's happened a crash and where you can locate the specific Last_Crash file with crash log.
(2) You can post crash reports on following forum: "Bug Reports about NGLE" ( http://www.aspidetr.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1748 )
