Parameters
----------

IdOrganizer  field

You should assign 1 at your first Organizer in that level section, and 2 for second organizer, ect.

Note: the valid range for IdOrganizer field is 1 / 4999


Flags Organizer (FO_..) field

You can get infos about FO_ constants from Reference panel of NG_center program, in _MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section.

Couples of Time + IdTriggerGroup
---------------------------------
After Parameter field, you can two one or more couple of field to store:

Time to wait before starting ...

TriggerGroup

You can imaginate these appointment infos.
At this hour, remember to do this
at other hour, to do this other...

But in our case we'll use the seconds, of course, anyway the method is the same.

For example if we create this Organizer command:

Organizer=1,  IGNORE, IGNORE, 
6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3


We should read above data in following way:


After 6 seconds from enabling of Organizer, it will be performed the TriggerGroup
 1
After other 5 seconds, it will be performed the TriggerGroup 2
After other 4 seconds, it will be performed the TriggerGroup 3

We can understand better these data using a table:
<PRE>
Time     TRiggerGroup
-----------------------
6        TriggerGroup=1
5        TriggerGroup=2
4        TriggerGroup=3
------------------------
</PRE>

Remark: in time field you can type number up to 65535, i.e. about 18 hours.
