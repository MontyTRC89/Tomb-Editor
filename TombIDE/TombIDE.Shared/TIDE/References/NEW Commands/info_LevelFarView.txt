Syntax: LevelFarView=NumberOfBlocks
Scope: To use in [Level] section

NumberOfBlocks is the number of sectors showed in game view.
Default value in old tomb4 was 20 sectors, this means that the mesh more far that 20 sectors from lara became black.

Valid range: Min=1  Max=127

Remark:
(1) The NumberOfBlocks you set with this command should be less or equal than value you set in [Options] section with "WorldFarView=" command, otherwise it will be ignored.
(2) For above remark you should insert in [Options] section a WordFarView= command with a big number and then set for different levels littler value with LevelFarView= in according with speed of game.
Remeber that not only the far view distance affects the speed of game but also (and overall) the number of meshes, transparent textures and moveables present in the level.
For this reason you could be forced to reduce the levelfarview for level with wide spaces and much moveables/meshes/transparent textures to enhance the speed, but in other level you could use a bigger levelfarview with no problem because the scene is more simple to draw for game engine.
