Syntax: Fmv= NumberFmv, EnableEscape
Scope: To use in [Level] section.

NumberFmv is the number of fmv file.

EnableEscape may have value 0 or 1. Value 1 means: "permit to playet to skip movie using Escape key"

The fmv file name must have following syntax: 

"FMV" + [Number] + [Extension]
For example, following names are correct for fmv files:

fmv4.wmv
fmv1.mpg
fmv43.avi

Differently it should be wrong to use following names:
fmv04.wmv     (there is a not meaningful "0" in front of "4")
fmv0.avi      (number start from "1")
fmv41      (Missing extension)
fmv5.bik    (".Bik" extension is not more supported
)


In script command "Fmv=" first number (NumberFmv) is number within the fmv file name.
For example working with file name "fmv3.wmv" you should write in script a command like:  Fmv=3,0

Remarks:

(1) Remember to set the wished extension with command "FMV=" used in [PCExtensions] section. (This "Fmv=" command has same name but don't confuse you, it is a different script command) 

(2) Really Fmv= command is not a new next generation command, it was present also in standard script.exe. Anyway only using TRNG engine you can really show FMVs in game.

(3) TRNG engine will look for fmv file in following sub-folders:
- Current folder (pratically the folder where is stored also trng engine, usually named "TRLE")
- Further folder named "FMVs" in current (trle) folder  "trle\FMVs\... fmv files"
- Further folder named "Store" in current (trle) folder "trle\store\... fmv files
