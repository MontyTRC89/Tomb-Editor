Syntax: Enemy=Slot, HP (vitality),  NEF_ flags, TombFlags (TCF_...), EXTRA_ flags, Damage1, Damage2, Damage3
Scope: To use in [Level] section
Max Number of instances for level section: 100

This command permits to set different settings for specific Slot objects.
You can set the HP (vitality, i.e. resistence to shot of Lara), the damage they give to Lara (damage1, damage2 ..).
Using some flags, like Ng Enemy Flags (NEF_...) or Tomb Enemy Flags  you can set particular behavior of slot.
You should use this command only con Slot = moveable enemies (baddies) or traps, anyway you can use this command also to change all moveables but many settings will have no effect in this case.

Arguments:
Slot field 
Wad slot to modify with this command. (See Slot Moveable list in Reference panel of NG_Center program)

HP (vitality) field
You can set resistance of this enemy to Lara' shots. 
For example if you set a big value (1000) it will be very difficultous kill it. If you set a little value (20) it will be killed with few revolver shots.

NEF_ flags field
This field accept values NEF_... (See Mnemonic Constants list in Reference panel)
 to chose different settings.
Currently there are following values for NEF_ flags:
NEF_EXPLODE
When creature will be killed it explodes
NEF_EXPLODE_AFTER
Like "nef_explode" , but the body will explode only after death animation is complete
NEF_HIT_BLOOD 
NEF_HIT_DEFAULT  
NEF_HIT_FRAGMENTS 
NEF_HIT_SMOKE
The NEF_HIT flags set the behavior of lara shots on the creature.
You can use only once NEF_HIT flag to set: blood, fragments, or smoke.
If you use NEF_HIT_DEFAULT the response to shots will be not changed. If you don't set any NEF_HIT ... flag, the shots will have no effect

NEF_NON_TARGET
 
Enemy becomes non targetable from lara and it will be immortal
NEF_NONE         
Reserved, don't use. If you want omit to set NEF_ flags you must type only IGNORE in this field
NEF_ONLY_EXPLODE
The enemy will become like skeleton or mummy. 
Apparently the common ammos will have no effect but explosive ammos will can destroy it.
NEF_SET_AS_CREATURE
Experimental. You can use a non enemy and non trap slot and to use this flag to transform it like an enemy. Pratically lara will can aim this  object and kill it (theorically but it's yet experimental)



NEF_SET_AS_MORTAL
This flag may be used with slot of semigod to transform then in mortal enemies. 
When you set this flag the enemy will be killed also with common ammos.

TombFlags (TCF_...) field
This field is only for experiment. It corresponds to Flags field of slot structure. If you type wrong values in this field you can have many troubles.
I suggest to set this field to IGNORE and to use only NEF flags to modify behavior of object (other NEF flags will be added in short time)
Read the description of TCF_... constants to discover some known flag for this field.

If you wish to do experiments with TombFlags field, here there are some values for well-known slots:
	$3A7B = used for skeleton
	$327B = used for von croy
	$3072 = used for guide
	$267B = used for baddy 1
	$0472 = used for big scorpion

EXTRA_ flags field
------------------
For most slots you can set this field to IGNORE, anyway there are some slots that require an extra value to type in this field.

Each EXTRA_ constant works only for one specific SLOT.
See description of EXTRA_... values in Reference Panel of NG_Center in MNEMONIC_VALUES section to have a description of EXTRA_ possible values.
 
Damage1/2/3 fields
You can type none, one or more values for damage that current enemy cause to Lara.
The reason to accept a variable number of values is because some Slot don't damage lara, while other moveables can damage lara in different ways, like baddy can hurt lara unsing UZI or sword, and in this situation you may type different damage, one for each type of damage.
To know when an enemy has one, two, three or none damage, read the Damage Enemy list in Reference panel of NG_Center program.
Remark:
If you want modify only one damage value but no other, you can use IGNORE null value to specify "don't change this damage kind".
For example if you want change only granade damage for SAS but you don't want change the UZI damage you can type following line:

Enemy=SAS, IGNORE, IGNORE, IGNORE, 0, IGNORE, 1000
Above command don't change HP, NEF_ flags, TombFlags.
Set to 0 Extra and with IGNORE first damage (UZI), while change the granade damage to 1000 (immediate death of lara with burning)

Remark:
- In Damage1/2/3 fields you should type only positive values. In some circustances you can type negative values but the result will be to recharge Lara vitality instead of hearting her. It should be weird.
- Remember to follow the Range limits  you read in Damage Enemy list, because if you set a value outside of range you could get unpredictable results about damage (anyway no crash will happen)
