Syntax: InputTimeout=FramesBy60

To use in [Options] section.

Set the frame rate of the game.
The argument is computed as Frames * seconds.
For example 18000 = 60 x 30 (30 frame per second)

It's better don't change this value because there are many old and slow computers that could have trouble using too high frame rates.
