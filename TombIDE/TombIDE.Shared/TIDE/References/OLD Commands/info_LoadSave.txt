Syntax: LoadSave= ENABLED/DISABLED

To use in [Options] section

Enable or disable the load / save operation in game.
If you set DISABLED in this command, the player will can not load game or save the game.

This command seems not very usefull, because it works for ALL levels.
It's strange, pheraps it's theorically possible set in [level] section a pickup item with data for Save game to create a game method like in tomb raider 3 for playstation, where player can save only after had picked up a blu crystal.
To explore...
