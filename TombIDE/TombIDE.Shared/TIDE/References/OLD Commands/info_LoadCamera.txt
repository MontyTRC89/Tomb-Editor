Syntax: LoadCamera= SourceX,SourceY,SourceZ,TargetX,TargetY,TargetZ,SourceRoom

Set the position of cam to create an image to use in 'load game' screen in game.

To use in [Level] section

Arguments:

1 - Source X position of cam in game units ("76406")
2 - Source Y position of cam in game units ("-3880")
3 - Source Z position of cam in game units ("40584")
4 - Target (where the cam is watching) X position ("75794")
5 - Target Y position ("-3220")
6 - Target Z position ("40328")
7 - Number of room where is placed the cam ("23")

It's not reasonable set manually these value.
You must read them and copy them in script.txt file using F1 key (1) while you are in game.
In top left corner of screen will be showed above numbers that are in according with current view the game in that moment.

Remark:
(1) F1 feature works only when in script.txt the command FlyCheat =	ENABLED.

(2) If there are two LoadCamera= commands in same [level] section, the game will use the second LoadCamera= command to set screen for loading savegame and reload screen after the death of lara.
Probably the first LoadCamera= will be used in some circustances with Finish trigger to jump to next level but I'm not sure.
