Syntax: Timer= ENABLED/DISABLED

To use in [Level] section

Enables or disables the overlapped timer used in Race For The Iris 

Remark:

To start the timer over the screen you must:

- To put Von Croy object in your level 
- Trigger (to get visibile) Von Croy
- Trigger flip effect 45

To stop the timer in traditional (game) ways is not easy.
However with Media Manager you can use an equipment media to set savegame field named "Screen timer" to 0. This method works correctly only if FIRST to perform this media in game has been triggered flip effect 45 with timer -1 (to stop movements of von croy) or flip effect 46 (to kill Von Croy)
