Syntax: UVrotate= SpeedOfScrollingTextures

To use in [Level] section.

Set the speed of UV Scrolling textures.

Arguments:

1- Speed texture animation ("8")
Apparently this number is a single byte (8 bit)
This means that write -2  or 254 has same results.

Range seems enclosed in -16  +16

If number is negative (or greather than 127)  direction of animation will be inverted.

Remark:
In previous versions of TRNG documentation it was been wrongly described this command how a way to affect the speed of waterfall textures. In the reality this command doesn't affect the waterfall textures but only the scrolling textures applied on the floor/walls of the level.
If you wish change the speed of waterfall textures you can use this script command:

Customize= CUST_WATERFALL_SPEED, NewSpeed

Where NewSpeed is a negative value to set the speed of scrolling.
See the description of CUST_WATERFALL_SPEED constant in Reference panel for more infos.
