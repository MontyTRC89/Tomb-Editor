There are some commands that is not clear how to do work them.

If you wish do experiments here there is the list of unknown script commands:

Weather= 
To use (I presume) in [Level] section
Probably works with ENABLED/DISABLED because in script.exe there is no magic word like "rain" or "snow" 
Remark: This command has been removed in Next Generation engine, and subtistuted with couple of commands Rain=Enabled/Disabled and Snow=Enabled/Disabled

StarField=
From its name it seems to regard night sky with stars but it's not clear how work.

Layer2=
The syntax of arguments is the same of Layer1= but what is the difference?

Security=
This command is in [Options] section and has always the value: $55 (eg 85 decimal) 
But what is this number?
Pheraps regards enabling/disabling other cheats, like that for infinite savegames, weapons ect.
Or is it used to ability the verifying of savegame with checksum compute?
Mistery...

Pulse=
Probably the syntax is: 
Pulse=ENABLED/DISABLED

NoLevel=
It's very bizzare, but this command is really used in Tomb Raider the last revelation.
This is the whole [level] section where it has been used:

[Level] 
Name= Yes 
NoLevel= ENABLED 
Level= A,0 

Of course, there is no A.tr4 level available.
Probably it's an hardcoded method to handle the conditional tests.
After seneth game there are two different paths and above "YES" level comes exactly before of that level.
Another NoLevel command is used in other level named "NO".
