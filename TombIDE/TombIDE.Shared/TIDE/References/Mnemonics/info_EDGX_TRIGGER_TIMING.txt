Used in DiagnosticType script command.
The trigger timing will show on screen the distance in frame ticks between a trigger activation and the following.
This could be useful to syncronize better cutscenes with organizer in the script.
Another interesting usage is to convert old method of rolling ball (to enable other trigger in sequence) with an organizer.
Organizer will reduce the used triggers on the map, moving them to the script.
The time you'll see on screen will be only the tick frames elapsed by last trigger activation.
