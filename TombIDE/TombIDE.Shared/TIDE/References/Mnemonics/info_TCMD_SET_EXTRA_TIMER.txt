Used in TriggerGroup= command.
This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.
It changes the following (real) trigger of current TriggerGroup, replacing the (E) Extra Timer value with that taken from trng variable set in next value (third value of current command trigger).

Range: 0/127
Scope: Used with Flipeffects and Action triggers. It is the "(E)xtra" parameter.

I'll do only a pair of examples about this command, anyway same speech could work also for other TCMD_SET_... commands.

First Example: change the time to self-closing of a door, in according with number of found secrets.
In game-play this means: ok, you (player) could not give a ship (censored) about looking for secrets but... I advise you that, at end of the level you'll have more time to reach the final exit-door if you picked up many secrets.

About the triggergroup to realise this target it will be based on trigger (to modify dinamically with TGROUP_COMMAND) like this:

; Set Trigger Type - ACTION 43
; Exporting: TRIGGER(1323:0) for ACTION(175) {Tomb_NextGeneration}
; (#) : DOOR_TYPE1                 ID 175    in sector (2,2) of Room 0
; (&) : Trigger. (Moveable) Activate (#)Object with (E)Timer value
; (E) : Timer= +05
; Values to add in script command: $5000, 175, $52B

Above trigger should open the Door and then wait 5 seconds before closing it.

If we, first of above exported trigger "$5000, 175, $52B", used a command trigger like this:
	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_SET_EXTRA_TIMER, #0800
We'll change the (E)timer value of following trigger, using the value stored in "Current Value" variable (its code is "#800")
Before of this two triggers we'll have to use trng variables, of course, to read the amount of secrets and then multiply it by some factor and then store this value in "Current Value" variable to modify the number of second to keep open the door.

Second Example: building a new custom elevator
Using the InputBox to receive a number (number of floor, for instance) and then multiply that value (stored in "Last Input Number" variable) and then we multiply it by some factor, then we can use the action trigger:

; Set Trigger Type - ACTION 30
; Exporting: TRIGGER(30:0) for ACTION(4) {Tomb_NextGeneration}
; (#) : DOOR_TYPE1                 ID 4      in sector (3,3) of Room0
; (&) : Move. Move up (#)animating for (E) clicks
; (E) :   1 clicks
; Values to add in script command: $5000, 4, $1E

And we'll use a bridge as animating to move.

Then, in the TriggerGroup, we'll set the TGROUP_COMMAND to change the Extra timer of above trigger, using the variable where  we saved the computation: LastInputNumber * (some factor, the number of clicks for floor).
