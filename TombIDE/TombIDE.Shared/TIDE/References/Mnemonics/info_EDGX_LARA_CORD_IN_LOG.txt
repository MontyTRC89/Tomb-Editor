Used in DiagnosticType script command.
This extra flag works only when you enabled the DGX_LARA to have Lara's data (animations, stateids) on screen.
If you add the EDGX_LARA_CORD_IN_LOG in ExtraDgxFlas of DiangosticType command, in the log will be showed the coordinates of Lara, too.

Note: by default the coordinates were missing in the log to reduce its size.
