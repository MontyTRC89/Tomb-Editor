Used into Customize=CUST_BACKGROUND command
This flag works only paired to BKGDF_KEEP_GAME_SCREEN flag.
With BKGDF_SEMI_TRANSPARENT flag you can force a custom image (with ImageId set in ImageId field of Customize=CUST_BACKGROUND command) over the current game scene, choosing the transparency level of your custom image.
You have to type in Parameter field the opacity level of your custom image with a value, where 0 = fully transparent and 255 = fully opaque.
Reasonable values will be in the range: 100 / 150.
