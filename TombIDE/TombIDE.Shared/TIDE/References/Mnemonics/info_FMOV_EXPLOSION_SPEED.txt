used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
This flag will give to the item a speed beginning from max value and decreasing enough slowly (remaining therefor on high values) in the progress.
This happen when an explosion throws awyay all items closed to it.
Note: warning there is no check about collisions. The item will stop its race only when it reaches the distance you set in Distance field.
The value you type in Speed field will be used as percentage to change the preset speed of this explosion movement.
If you type 100, no change will be performed. 200 will double the speed (unsuggested, increase this speed), 50 will reduce by half the preset speed. Ect.
