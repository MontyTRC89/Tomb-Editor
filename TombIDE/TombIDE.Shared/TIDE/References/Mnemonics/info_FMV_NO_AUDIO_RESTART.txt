Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.
By default, trng stops the cd track before starting the FMV, and restart the same cd in same position when the FMV has been completed.
In some cirucstance you could wish to avoid to restart the cd track at end of fmv , this could happens  for example when you mean change the cd track at end of fmv or load another level.
In above situation the cd track just restarted should be immediatly newly stopped to be changed with new track. Since this operation is a bit boring to listen you can use the FMV_NO_AUDIO_RESTART flag to let the silence at end of fmv, so you can start new different cd track with some trigger in more sweet way.
