Used in TestPosition command.
The alignment with some objects could fail because the main mesh has an opposite facing respect to animation 0 displacement.
You can discover this situation with Animation Editor of Wad Merger: when the position of mesh with "No Animation" is the opposite of mesh in "Animation 0" you are in this situation and the self alignment could fail.
To fix this bug you can use the TPOS_OPPOSITE_FACING flag in the TestPosition command used by your Animation command.
