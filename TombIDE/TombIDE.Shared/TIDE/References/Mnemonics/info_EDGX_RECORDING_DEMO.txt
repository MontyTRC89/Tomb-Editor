Used in DiagnosticType script command.
This flag enables in game the demo recorder.
You can read the available keyboard commands on the screen, anyway it's better if you read following notes and hints.

- The max durate for recording is about 25 minutes. If you reach this limit the recording will be stopped byself.

- In first row of Recorder there will be the name of demo#.pak file currently active. If this name has a # sign in front, it means that this demo#.pak file exists really on disk.
You should take care that when you enable the recording with a demo file with the # sign in front, you are going to overwrite it.

- You can change the current demo#.pak file active, using the keys "Q" and "W".
With "Q" you reduce by 1 the current Demo index, while with "W" you increase this index.
Valid range is between 1/999

- Editing of demo files includes a simple backup method. Everytime you erase current demo.pak, using the "e" (erase) command, trng will rename current demo#.pak name as demo#.backup file. In this way the demo#.pak is no more present (erased) but its previous content will be saved in corresponding demo#.backup file.
A backup file will be created also when you begin a new (fresh) recording while it was selected an already existing demo#.pak file.
If you wish restore the backup file and to do became it the main demo.pak file (cancelling last erase/recording overwrite operation) you can use the "r" (restore) command.

- In the demo editing infos on screen you can see also the indices of currently selected Leading actor ("L-actor) or Extra Actor ("E-actor").
If you don't see above descriptions it means that you have not assigned a role for that (missing) actor role.

- If you added to the script and organizer linked with the demo you are recording or playing, it will be performed also in editing mode. Anyway you can disable it (but only in editing mode) with F4 key.

- At start, the game will move on higher free demo index. This means you can record a new demo file avoiding overwritting.
If you wish play some demo file from disk, you can use Q/W keys to choose the demo file and then hit F10 key.
If when you choose an existing demo file (you discover this because it has the # sign in front of demo name), but the info about "F10 to play the demo" is missing, this means that demo has not been recorded in current level and for this reason it's neither possible playing it in current level.

- When you are playing a demo file, you can stop hit with Escape key or trimming it with F11 or F12 keys.

While Escape stops only the playing with no change on current demo, the f11 key will remove the part from the begin of the demo until now (when you hit F11 key), while the F12 key will stop the play and also it will truncate the demo at the moment when you hit F12 key.
Therefor you can use F11 and F12 key (on playing) to edit a demo file, removing beginning or ending part from it.

Note: if the Escape command doesn't work, it happens because you typed a Demo script command in same level section where you are playing the demo.pak file, and in the demo= script command is missing the DEMF_QUIT_WITH_ESCAPE flag.
While you are yet editing demo.pak files in game, it's better add that flag to demo script command, or remove temporary the demo script command from the script with a semicolon ";" character.

- While playing is in progress you can pause the playing, freezing the game keeping down the F8 key.
This is useful to read the current frame number. Then you can use this info with a demo organizer or to set a condition C86 or C87 to perform some trigger only when demo is playing exactly that frame to have a better syncronization for special effects.
Note: everytime you hit F8 key to stop demo, the number of that frame will be saved to a log file "cutscene_log.txt" in trle folder. In this way you can stop in different moment and then read all stop-point frames.

Note: about the choice to use C86/87 conditions on the path of lara, or to use a demo organizer (an organizer with the FO_DEMO_ORGANIZER flag) syncronized with the demo, it depends by the number of trigger to perform in the progress of the demo. If you have only one or two triggers it’s more easy using C86/87 condition. While when the triggers are much more it’s better using a demo organizer.

- The F9 key allows the so called "Add recording" operation.
With this operation you continue the recording of current demo, after a previous recording or playing phase.
Note that is not always possible having the add recording: if you have just selected (with q/w keys) a demo, the add recording will be not possibile until you don't play current demo, in fact, it's necessary that lara was in the final position of current demo to continue the recording from final position of it.
If you wish replace the second part of a demo with a new recording (with f9 key), you have to play the demo and then stop it with f12 or escape key. After this command, the following f9 key will add a recording after the previous stop point, overwritting the (previous) final part.

Note: the add recording operation maybe useful in two circustances:
* When you had recorded a long and complicated demo and you wish preserve first part but, in same time, replace the final part to correct something of it.
* When you wish add many special effects to your cutscene/demo but you need to know the position of frame where set these trigger before continuing. In this case you'll record a part of the demo, then discover the frame where add a trigger, then repeat the demo, and at end, with f9 key you'll continue the recording having the trigger already placed to be able to interact with new game scene changed by above trigger.

Remark: when you stop a demo with the project of continue the recording in a second moment, you should choose a stop point where lara is still, otherwise the final demo playing will have problems of synchronization.
For instance you can not stop a recording while lara  is falling down in the empty, because when you stop del demo, lara will continue to fall down anyway, and when you'll add the recording the position of lara will be no the real final position of previous part of recording.
Alike speech when lara is running or performing other actions that she will continue to do for a bit, when you stop the playing.

- Remember that not always the playing of the demo just recorded can works fine. It happens when in the recording phase, lara changed some items in the game that will be different (missing/killed, moved, already enabled ect) for this reason, in following playing.
For instance if lara, in recording phase, enables an enemy and then she kills him, when you perform the play the enemy will be missing, since he has already been enabled and kiled.
To avoid this problem it's better saving the game before beginning a recording, in this way when you wish play the demo just reloading the savegame to come back to previous game situation and then hit F10 key to play the demo from same initial status.

- Another situation where the playing could be different than recording is when lara interacts with enemies. Since there are some random actions in some enemies, these different movement could affect the behavior of lara (when she is aiming the enemy) or when an enemy touches lara, moving (or turning) a bit her.
For this reason the more sure demos are those where lara has no enemy to aim and no enemies that touches her.

- The demo files will be saved/loaded from Data folder. In data folder you can also find a DemoInfos.txt file with a descriptive list of demo#.pak files stored in Data folder.

- There are some limitations about beginning position of lara at moment of recording.
Lara cann't be hanged on rope (and probably, pole-rope), and neither to be driving a vehicle.
It's not possible begin the recording from inventory or other "paused" screen.
Anyway, in spite of these limitation, you can to do to lara all above actions but only in the middle of the recording.
This means you can begin with lara in stand-up position and then move her to hang on pole-rope, or drive the jeep, or enter in inventory to choose an item ect.
Theorically it should be possible beginning a recording while lara is standing-up, climbing, monkeying, running, jumping, shooting, falling, floating on water or swimming underwater.
Differently, it may be problematic beginning with lara is walking (SHIFT+Arrows) because the mode to detect down/release of shift key is very particular and beginning with shift key down it will take weird troubles.

- About middle phase of recording you should avoid only to load savegames since a demo should work only within a level environment.

- The demo recorder is able to record only the standard game commands, those you can see in Option/Control Configuration screen, plus the digits between 0-9.
For this reason if you use custom scancode to perform special animation or other new features, these will be not recorded and then played.

You have also to use Action (CTRL) key to convalidate the numbers and not the [Enter/Return] key.

- Expiration of a demo file.
Probably you'll record the demos on final version of your levels, anyway in the case you changed something after having recorded a demo, you have to learn when these changes could get troubles for demo playing.

*You should avoid the change of equipment of inventory items when in the demo lara choose some item from inventory, because with some missing or more item, the movement to select correct item could change. In this situation a trick could be to record the demo when the selected item (first item selected in inventory) is own that lara will choose. In this way it will work also adding or removing items from inventory.

*It may be dangerous change lara object in wad file, adding or removing animations, frames or meshes.

*Do not change geometry of room where lara will move in the demo, of course, anyway it's not serious if you add new rooms or change textures, triggers, sounds or other non-collisional stuff.

- Please, remember the fundamenal improvement of C25 condition trigger: now there is the new mode "Demo/Custscene mode" for this condition

Thank to this condition you can place trigger (casted with above C25 condition) that will be enabled only in demo mode.
This could be useful to improve your demo/cutscene with many triggers that will be no triggered in common game mode, also if lara will come back in that room where you do pass her in the demo.
Another important benefit is that you can use these triggers (working only in demo mode) to prepare the demo with all correct enemey enabled or door opened or weapon/pickups got, ect.

For instance...

If you wish show a demo where lara fights with the final monster of your level (reached after a long path) and she is using a new weapon (that in common game will be get only after picking up many sub-items) you need for your demo to have already lara closed to the monster place, with the special weapon in inventory and with the monster already enabled.

It's important understand that the demo doesn't save all features of the game but only the lara position+status and her following movements, given from input control.

So, since (for a demo from title) lara will begin when the level is at start, she (in above example) will have NO special weapon, yet, and she will be very very far from the place with monster. About the distance is not a problem, since if you begin the recording when lara is closed to the montster room, when the demo it will be played, lara will be moved immediatly in that position.

While to solve other problems, you have to place in the sector where you begin the recording, the (C25 casted) triggers to add in inventory the special weapon and to enable (trigger) the monster.
You'll record only from this sector, closed to the monster, where lara will trigger the adding of special weapon and the monster.
All above triggers will be casted with C25 condition to be enabled ONLY in demo mode. In this way they will not affect the game playing when lara will move over them in common game.
By other hand it's necessary understand that above triggers have to be present also in final release of your level, otherwise the demo will not work. For this reason you cann't simply change temporary your level (adding triggers), to record the demo, and then remove these triggers.
To reconstruct the situation that lara should have in different moment and sides of your level, you have to place and let there, many c25 triggers that will reproduce in fast way equipment and situation that in common playing should require a lot of time to be gotten.

- Tips and tricks: Adding different view of Lara with fixed camera, flybycamera or maxtrix or potrait effect improve your demo, anyway it's complicate recording the demo and move lara correctly when you have not a normal view of the game.
The trick to solve this problem is simply to add in a second moment the triggers (with c25 condition) to enable different viewing of the game. In this way you'll record (and drive lara) with a common view to avoid errors, while after you completed the recording you place c25+camera trigger in the path of lara in the demo, and in this way in final playing you'll have many suggestive camera views.

- There is also the new flipeffect (F379) "Cutscene. Perform the demo.pak with [&index] in (E)way" to launch a demo from a [Level] section to do work it like a cutscene.
Also to create cutscene the C25 casted triggers are very important. To change camera view, setting animating with special custom animations, adding texts and new background sound or music, ect.
See above point about C25 condition for more infos.
