From version 1.1.9.8 this FAN has new properties.
When you add this flag and you set some valid ENV_POS_... flags in Evironment field (see following description) the position of lara will be forced to be the ideal position in according with ENV_POS_ values before performing your custom animation.
For example if you set ENV_POS_HORTOGONAL, an instat before starting the special animation the lara orientation will be aligned with hortogonal axis.
Remark: by default the alignment operation is a bit poor, since TRNG move immediatly lara in ideal position without any progressive movement.
Anyway from versione 1.1.9.8, when you set FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS in according with ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION condition, you can get a progressive self adjustment in game like you see in default tomb4 when lara open a door or push a pushable object.
This feature will use the data you set in TestPosition command and extracts from it the ideal position to reach, using intermediate values for each difference range you set.
This feature don't work fine if lara was performing a state id different by stand-up position or swimming underwater.
Warning: when you set ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION and the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS the orient information will be read only from TestPosition command, so the further ENV_POS_... FLAGS you add in EnvCondition will be ignored.
