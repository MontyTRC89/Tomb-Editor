Used in GlobalTrigger command.
This flag doesn't change the behavior of the globaltrigger in runtime, but it removes the debugging mexages in debug mode (DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS diagnostic) for this globaltrigger.
The reason to use this flag is when you are studying another script command but this global trigger continues to fill the log with many mexages not intersting for you.
