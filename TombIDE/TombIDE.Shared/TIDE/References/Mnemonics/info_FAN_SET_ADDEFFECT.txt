You can add a particle effect when your animation will be performed.
You have to create a AddEffect= script command to specify what particle effect to use. Then you add current flag FAN_SET_ADDEFFECT in FAN field, and you type the number of AddEffect command in Extra field of Animation= command.
Remark: by default the effect will have an infinite durate, anyway you can override this setting using correct flag in AddEffect= command to have the durate of effect only when some stateid or animation number is on.
