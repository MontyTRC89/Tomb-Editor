Used in StandBy command.
Usually the camera will start from current standard position and it will move slowly to reach the position required from the settings of StandBy command.
If you wish the camera starts immediatly in new required position you can use the FSB_IMMEDIATE flag,and the camera will be moved immediatly in the new position.
