Used in TestPosition command
If you want that the correct position to detect could be in front of object (with given H Orient) but also in the opposite side, you can set this flag.
When in TestPosition there is the TPOS_DOUBLE_HORIENT flag, the testposition condition will be true also if lara is in opposite side for what you set the ranges of testposition.
For example using an item like a gate, you can use TPOS_DOUBLE_HORIENT to permit to lara to be in correct position for both side of the gate.

Remark: this flag works fine only if the item has its pivot in same position of visible mesh.
Unfortunately, in many circustances the pivot (origin x,y,z of object) is not at center of its mesh but in a corner of sector where it will be placed.
