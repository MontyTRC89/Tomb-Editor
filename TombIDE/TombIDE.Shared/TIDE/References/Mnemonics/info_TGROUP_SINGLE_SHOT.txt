Used in TriggerGroup command
Adding this flag in first number of first trigger of TriggerGroup you create a single-shot Trigger group.

Pratically this triggergroup will be performed only once in current level, indifferently by how much times for it, it will be required an execution with the "Perfrom TriggerGroup" flipeffect.

The single-shot trigger groups are very important to fix that limitation about the trigger zone where you place same trigger in two or more closed sectors in the map.
When you wish that all this trigger zone worked like a single-shot trigger you have a problem, because each trigger will work in one-shot way but individually and this means that lara could engages newly the same trigger when she will touches another sector in that trigger zone.
Currnetly the only way to avoid this problem is to export the trigger in script format and copy it in a TriggerGroup command. Then add to first number the TGROUP_SINGLE_SHOT flag, and at end replace in the level the original trigger with a "perform trigger group" flipeffect.
In this way the triggergroup will be performed only once, and when lara will pass over other trigger sectors of that same zone, noting will happen.

Remark: There is also a new flipeffect whereby it you can enable newly a single-shot triggergroup already performed.
