Syntax: Customize=CUST_SHATTER_RANGE, FirstStaticAsShatter, LastStaticAsShatter

By default you have only 10 statics with shatter attribute (from SHATTER0 to SHATTER9) but using this cust_ setting you can enlarge the number of shatter statics.
Default values are:
FirstStaticAsShatter = 50 (SHATTER0)
LastStaticAsShatter = 59 (SHATTER9)

Looking "Static list" in reference panel you can see the name (and IDs) of all static meshes and you should choice if you want have more shatter as following statics or previous statics.
For example If you want have other 10 static meshes as shatter, and you want that becomes shatter the statics following the standard shatter objects, just you type this command:

Customize=CUST_SHATTER_RANGE, 50, 69

In this way the 10 following statics (from EXTRA00 to EXTRA09) will become shatter objects.

Differently, if you don't want change EXTRA statics, and you prefer use as shatter the statics come first of standard Shatter, you can type following command:

Customize=CUST_SHATTER_RANGE, 40, 59

In this way all static from DEBRIS0 to DEBRIS9 will become shatters.
