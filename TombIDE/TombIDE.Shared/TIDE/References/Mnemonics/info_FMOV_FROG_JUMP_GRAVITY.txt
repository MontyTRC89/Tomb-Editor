used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
This flag will be move upward the item and then it will fall down, like a jump of a frog. The shape of the jump should be regular, i.e. the ascendent (beginning) part, will have the inverse shape in descendent final part.

Note: you can type a percentage variation of vertical speed in the Speed field using following formula:

PercentageOfChangeVerticalSpeed * 256 + HorizontalSpeed

Remember that you can not type a value higher than 255.

The value of PercentageOfChangeVerticalSpeed  work around the 100 value, that should be "no change".
If you wish double the vertical speed, use 200, while if wish the half of preset vertical speed, you'll use 50.
