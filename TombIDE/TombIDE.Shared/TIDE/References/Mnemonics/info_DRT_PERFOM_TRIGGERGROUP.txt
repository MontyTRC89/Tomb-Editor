Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command
If you add this flag you can transform the dart emitter in a sort of sensor line, where, when a dart touches lara, it will be perfomed some trigger.
Pratically it could be like an electronic alarm. In this case you have to type in IdTriggerGroup field the ID of trigger group to perform.

Remarks:

- You can reduce the speed and change the color (for example with red or green) to give to the dart emitting the look of a laser ray.

- If you use the dart emitter like a sensory line is advisable disable the poison with the DRT_NO_POISON flag, since it has no sense the poisoning performed by a laser ray and also the smoke and crash sound wiht the DRT_NO_SMOKE flag.

- When some dart touches Lara and the triggergroup will be performed the index of the dart emitter will be stored in the internal variable [Found item index]. In this way you could insert in the trigger group also an action trigger using the TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag, to disable that dart emitter with this action trigger:

; Exporting: TRIGGER(44:0) for ACTION(0)
; <#
 : LARA                       ID:0      in sector:(8,7) of Room3
; <&
 : Trigger. (Moveable) Untrigger <#
Object with (E)Timer value
; (E) : Timer= +00
; Values to add in script command: $5000, 0, $2C

and the values will be added in triggergroup command in this way:

TriggerGroup=  ....  ,$5000 + TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX, 0, $2C

to use the found index instead of that set in original trigger (it was lara)

- The best way to have a very realistic laser sensory line avoiding in same time to slow down the engine is to disable the showing of darts with the DRT_HIDE_DART flag to free cpu time.
Disable smoke and crash sounds with the DRT_NO_SMOKE.
Disable also the poisoning with DRT_NO_POISON flag.
Now we should decrease furhter the emittingtimer of a bit to have most invisible dart showed. This is necessary to avoid that Lara was able to pass our sensory line without touching the darts.
Now the only problem is that the sensory line is fully invisible. We can solve this problem using a static object with no collision builded like the tight-rope bar, and adding to it the same texture used for waterfall to give to it a pulse/flushing effect.
Then in NGLE just place the dart emitting in some direction and hight and then place also the static sensory bar in same position where the darts should be emitted to have many pulsing semi-transparent laser sensory in our very hi-tech level. Each of this sensory line could be used like trigger to activate other stuff like enemys, doors, flipmaps ect.
