Used in Switch script command.
If you want introduce random elements in your adventure you can use this flag to perform different triggers in random way.
When you use the SWT_RANDOM_MODE flag, the field VariablePlaceFolder will be ignored, and the number used to select the TriggerGroup to perform will be generated in random way.
For example if you place three triggergroup IDs in the list, when you perform this switch the trng engine will generate a random number in the range (1 - 3) (or 0 - 2 if you use BASE_ZERO flag), and then it will perform the trigger group in according with this random number.
