Perform your special animation only if lara has NO block in front of her face. In "Distance for Env" field you set the height of block. For example if you set 1024 (height of one sector) trng will consider true the condition "no block in front" if the floor in front of lara is higher less than 1024 units respect current floor where lara is. While if floor in front of lara is high 1024 units or more, it will be detected a block in front of lara.
