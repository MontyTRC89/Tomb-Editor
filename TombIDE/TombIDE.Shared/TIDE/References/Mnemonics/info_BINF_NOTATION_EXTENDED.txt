Used into Customize=CUST_BINOCULARS command
When you enabled compass infos but you didn't use the compass strip, the info about compass will be showed as a number of degrees.
The short notation is like: 123°
where the degrees begin from 0 (north) increasing in clockwise sorting passing through 90° (EAST), 180° (SOUTH) and 270° (WEST)
If you wish, you can use the extended notation, where the degrees will cover only 0-89° degrees, beginning from first cardinal point.
Example:  "N 45°"
It means NE (or 45°)
"E 20°"  means "110°" in (about) South-east direction
