This condition used to detect if there is an object of given TestPosition command is in correct position with respect to Lara.
The ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION has same target of ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_.... conditions but in this case you can accurately compare for an item in any position with respect to Lara and in absolute precise mode.
The other env conditions have some problems to detect the exact distance when the pivot of Lara and the item are too different.
To use the ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION you have to type in script a "TestPosition=" script command with all data necessary for the detection, and then you'll type in DistanceForEnv field of Animation= or MultEnvCondition= commands the IdTestPosition (first argument of TestPosition).

Remark:
The ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION condition (like other ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_... conditions) has the limit to check only for items in same room where lara is.
If you want detect an item in a room different than Lara room, the only way is to set in TestPosition command the flag TPOS_TEST_ITEM_INDEX in this way you can set in Slot field (of TestPosition) an index of specific item instead a generic slot type.

See description of TestPosition script command in the list "SCRIPT NEW commands" of Reference panel of NG_Center program, to have more informations.
