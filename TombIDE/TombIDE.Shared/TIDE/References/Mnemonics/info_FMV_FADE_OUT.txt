Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.
If you wish there was a fade out before start the FMV you can add the FMV_FADE_OUT in FlagsFMV field of Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.
Remark: fade-out means the game will become darker until to black and only after this changing the video will be played.
