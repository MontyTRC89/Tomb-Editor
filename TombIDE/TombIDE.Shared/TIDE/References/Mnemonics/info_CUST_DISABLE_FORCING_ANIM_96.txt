Used by Customize= command

Syntax: Customize=CUST_DISABLE_FORCING_ANIM_96

By default, when lara is moving left or right in hang mode and reach a corner the engine force the animation 96.
This behavior is good of course, but if you are writting new hanging animation that forcing of animation 96 could create troubles to your new hanging management.
Using this cust value the engine will not force anim 96, allowing to use custom animation to round the corner
