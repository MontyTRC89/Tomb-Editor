Used in Demo script command.
By default the first demo will begin with a fade-in (from black to game screen), anyway if you used DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE or DEMF_PLAY_ALL_SEQUENCE, you can add cross fade to swap the two demo while the game screen is black.
If you omit this flag in a demo sequence, lara will disappear from last position of first demo, and she will appear (suddenly) in new room and position of start point of second demo.
The disvantage to use cross fade is that the last frames of first demo and the first frames of following demo, will be darked.
