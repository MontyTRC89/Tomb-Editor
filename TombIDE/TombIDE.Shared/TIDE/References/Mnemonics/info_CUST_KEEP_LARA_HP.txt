Used with Customize command.

Syntax: Customize=CUST_KEEP_LARA_HP, TargetLevel

With this customize you can avoid the automatic recharging of lara HP when she jumps to another level from the current.

TargetLevel field
-----------------
You type in this field the index of the target level where lara will arrive keeping previous HP value.
Example:
We suppose that your adventure has three levels, where the level 1 and the level  2 are the two halfs of a wide environment and lara jumps on and back from these two levels many times.
Then there is the level 3 where lara will go only after solved all puzzles of first two levels.
In this situation you could wish that lara was not able to recharge her HP simply going on and back from the gate between level 1 and level 2.
So to keep same hp in above situation you should place in [Level] section of level 1 the command:

Customize=CUST_KEEP_LARA_HP, 2

While the in the [Level] section of level 2:

Customize=CUST_KEEP_LARA_HP, 1

About level 3 is not necessary type anything since when this command is missing by default lara will be recharged when she jumps to level 3

Remark: if you wish keep always the HP of lara, i.e. no recharge for all levels, you can use the special constants KLH_ALL_LEVELS instead of the target level:

Customize=CUST_KEEP_LARA_HP, KLH_ALL_LEVELS

In this way, for any level where lara jumps, starting from current, she will keep the old HP value.
