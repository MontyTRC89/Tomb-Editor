Used with Customize= command
Syntax: Customize=CUST_FIX_BUGS, BugsToFix flags (BUGF_...)

This customize accepts one or more BUGF_... flag to fix some bug in tomb raider engine.
The reason to let customizable the bug fixing (instead by fixing always byself) is because some level builders could have built some skill own based on some bug of old engine, other the chance that a bug fixing in some critical module of tomb raider could generate some unwished collateral effect.

Note: in BUGF_ flags you'll find some bug fixing already seen with other mnemonic constant in other script commands, like CUST_FIX_WATER_FOG_BUG  or DRT_FIX_POISON_BUG.
You can fix above bugs in both ways: with old (above) constants or with the new BUGF_ constants.
Anyway in the future all bugs to fix will be set only as BUGF_ constants to find them more easily in a single command.

See the BUGF_ constant in Reference panel of NG Center for more infos.
