If you put two or more AI_FOLLOW (other that is below the moveable) you must set same OCB value for start AI_FOLLOW and next AI_FOLLOW.
Differently the following AI_FOLLOW objects will increase the ocb value of 1.
For example:

First AI_FOLLOW  = OCB 1 (below the moveable you want move)
Second AI_FOLLOW = OCB 1 (where moveable will go)
Third AI_FOLLOW = OCB 2 (further target)
Fourth AI_FOLLOW  = OCB 3 (ect)

Remark:
AI_FOLLOWs used for move enemy jeep should start from value -2 and follow above rule.
