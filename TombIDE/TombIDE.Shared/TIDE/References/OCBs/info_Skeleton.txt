Remark: 
- You can change the initial animations by setting the trigger flags as listed below. If you don't set trigger flags the skeleton will come up out of the ground as normal. When placed, he is 20 clicks below the floor elevation.
- Put an AI_GUARD object on the skeleton to put him on guard. 

1 = Jump Right. He jumps about a block
2 = Jump Left. As above
3 = Playing dead. This skeleton is visible (lying down) before being triggered and only gets up when triggered
