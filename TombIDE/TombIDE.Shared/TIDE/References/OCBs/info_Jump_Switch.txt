Set 1 as ocb if you want have a reability of lever after 'timer' seconds.
For example if you in switch trigger insert in timer field the value 12 and put '1' in ocb of jump switch the trigger (for example for a door) will be activated for 12 seconds, then this time, the door will be closed and the lever will go up newly.
Remark: not all 'jump switches' have reability function, you should use jump switch you find in guard.wad file.
