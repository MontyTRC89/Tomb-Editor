Used in Diary= command.
This layout is very similar than above PL_CENTRAL_IMAGE layout, but in this case the image will be fit to cover the 90% of screen.
If you use this layout you should create the image to be wide but not very heigh, otherwise it could cover the whole tomb raider screen.
The usage of this layout could be useful to show two little image in each page, the trick is simply to create a unique image where there are two pictures one at left and the other at right.
