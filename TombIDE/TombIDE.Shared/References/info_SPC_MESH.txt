Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
With this command you choose directly the head mesh to show.
The number you'll add to SPC_MESH command if the relative index, beginning from zero, respect first speech mesh.
For example:

SPC_MESH+4

this means: the fifth mesh (0,1,2,3,4  are 5 meshes)
If you wish set a frame durate different than framerate field, you can add the number of frames for durate:
The number of frames has to be multplied by 64:
For instance:

SPC_MESH+256+4

means: show mesh with index=4 (fifth mesh) for 4 frames (4 * 64 = 256)

Note: Since SPC_MESH command has value = 0, you can omit to type it, just you avoid to insert any other SPC_ command:

For instance:

256+4

is the same of:

SPC_MESH+256+4

If you let default frame rate for durate (useful to be able, in a second moment, to change the speed of whole sequence in fast way), you can type simply the number of mesh:

For instances these:

 2,1,0,0,2

are a sequence of SPC_MESH commands with default frame rate of durate.
