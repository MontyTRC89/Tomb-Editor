Signal a multiple condition. The effective ENV condition flags will be stored in a MultEnvCondition script command, and in DistanceForEnv you have to type the ID of MultEnvCondition command will be used.
 The final condition will be true only if all conditions in MultEnvCondition command will be true in same time.
Examples:

If you want set in your animation command two Env condition, like: ENV_CEILING_HEIGHT with height (distance env) = $300 (3 clicks) + other condition: ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT with depth (distance env) = $400 (4 clicks) you can as first step create this MultEnvCondition command:

MultEnvCondition= 1, ENV_CEILING_HEIGHT, $300, ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT, $400

and then type in Animation command the reference for Id of above MultEnvCondition (1) and the ENV_ condition: ENV_MULT_CONDITION

For example:

Animation=447, KEY1_LEFT, IGNORE,IGNORE,ENV_MULT_CONDITION, 1,IGNORE,-445, -448
