Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
Move the head at right.
This command accept two arguments:
- The angle about turning respect to forward looking (0 degrees)
- The time spent for turning and still in turned position.

Since both arguments cann't be bigger than value 63, to have a larger choice the format is not in frame and single degrees but rather:
- The angle will be set in double degrees of wished degrees. In this way if you type 45 the turning will be by 90 degrees.
- The durate is in teenths of second, so with max value, 63, you can reach six seconds of right looking. The durate has to be multiplied by 64.

For instance, if you wish a turning of 45 degrees, kept for 2.5 seconds, the formula will be:

SPC_LOOK_RIGHT+22+1600

The 22 will be multiplied by 2 from trng to get 44 (about 45), while 1600 is 25 * 64, and 25 teenth of second are 2.5 seconds, of course.

Notes: 

- All SPC_LOOK... and SPC_HEAD_ commands work only with Lara. If you wish have same effect for other moveable it will be necessary creating a new custom animation to move the head and then use a SPC_ANIMATION command to force that animation.

- All SPC_LOOK and SPC_HEAD commands will be overlapped to the following commands in their playing. 
This means that this command will start immediatly the turning of head, but in same frame, it will begin also next command, for example to move actor's mouth.
If you wish that trng waits that the turning was completed before performing next command, you have to add after this LOOK command a SPC_PAUSE command with the same time durate of this LOOK command.
