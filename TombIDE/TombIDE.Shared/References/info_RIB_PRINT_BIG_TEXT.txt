Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX
If you set this flag in RIB_Flags field, when the background image of input box has been draw, and first to read/draw the text typed by player, it will be drawn the text of trng variable "Big Text".
When you set this flag, it's necessary type also, in ExtraParam field of Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX script command, the id of some Parameters=PARAM_RECT script command. The data of PARAM_RECT it will be used to set the rectangle (in micro units) where to draw the "Big Text" string. It will be used also the "ForeColor" field (of PARAM_RECT script command), to set the color of the text, while, the "BackColor" field, it will be ignored.
This is the description of RIB_PRINT_BIG_TEXT flag, anyway it should be important also explain why you should use this flag, rather to draw simply, on background image, further text.
The idea, behind RIB_PRINT_BIG_TEXT flag, is to have a generic input box, for instance with a background image showing a computer screen, that you'll be able to use over and over, with different text and therefore, requiring different passwords or input commands, to perform some operations in the game.
If you use this method, you should remember to perform the F409 trigger, to show the input box, within a TriggerGroup, where, first of F409 trigger, there will be a trigger to copy some text (from strings of .dat files) in "Big Text" variable.
In this way you'll be able to customize everytime, in run-time, the texts to show, in this "pc/control panel" input box, in game.
