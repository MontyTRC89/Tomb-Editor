Used in GlobalTrigger= command.
This global trigger will be enabled when the given elevator has just stopped at given floor.
You could use this trigger to open a door in front of elevator.
You type the elevator index and the floor number in Parameter field.
Since you have to put two numbers is a single field it's necessary perform a little compute to compact the two numbers in a single number.

The formula to get this unique number is:

(FloorNumber * 4096) + ElevatorIndex

You cann't type above row in that way, of course, because NG_Center doens't recognize the "*" multiply character or the parenthesis.
Differenty you have to perform the compute and then type only the final number.
For example if you want verify when the elevator with Index = 137, reachs the first floor (floornumber= 1), the compute will be:

(1 * 4096) + 137

and we'll get:

4233

Remarks: 

1) At start of the level all elevators will give the GT_ELEVATOR_STOPS_AT_FLOOR event with the floor number = 1, since all elevators have to begin with the cage at first floor.
In this way if you use this global trigger to have a door opened in front of the floor where is the elevator it will work also from start of the level.

2) There is a limitation for both values to set in parameter field: 
The elevator index cann't be greather than 4095
The floor number cann't be greather than 15
If you have to use number bigger than above limits you have a big problem, because the size of single field of GlobalTrigger script command don't permit to have number bigger than above limits.
