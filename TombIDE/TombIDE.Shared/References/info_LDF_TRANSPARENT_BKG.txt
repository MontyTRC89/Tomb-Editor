Used in Diary command.
This flag informs trng that, in your background images, there could be transparent zones.
The transarent color is the standard transparent color used in tomb4: $FF00FF(red = 255; green=0; blue=255)
You could use this setting if you wish that the diary had a not perfect rectangular shape. For example if you wish have a rounded shape you can place transparent color in the four corners.

Remarks: 
- This setting has no effect about popup images showed in little frames of some page. The pop up images are always showed supporting the transparent color.

- The LDF_TRANSPARENT_BKG flag doens't work fine with the PL_FIX_WIDE_SCREEN flag about page layout, because, when there is a wide-screen and this flag, the image will be stretched before showing it and in this phase the transparence effect will show a distorsion between real background and new stretched background in transparent zones.

- If you use LDF_TRANSPARENT_BKG flag togheter with LDF_ZOOM_START flag, for technical reasons, the image showed in the zoom effect will have no texts and neither further pop-up image. Pratically it will be zoomed only first background images for diary, and only when zoom effect has been completed, it will be added texts and pop up images.

- If you mean set a transparent zone in the background of your diary it's necessary that all (further) background images (you can change the background for each page) had the transparency in same zones, otherwise you'll get a transparency only showing a zone of previous page instead of tomb raider screen.
