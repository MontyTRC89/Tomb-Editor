This global trigger works like GT_COLLIDE_ITEM but in this case you have to type a slot number both a specific item index.
Pratically you can use GT_COLLIDE_SLOT to test the collision of Lara with any item of a given slot.
For example if you create this GlobalTrigger:

GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_COLLIDE_SLOT, 41, ...

Since 41 is the slot for BADDY_1 object, everytime lara will collide with any BADDY_1 object the global trigger will be engaged.

Remark: When the collision will be detected, the item of moveable is colliding Lara, will be saved to be used from triggers stored in perform TriggerGroup. In particular way you have to use the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX togheter with some trigger that works on some moveable. For example if global trigger detect a collision with moveable with slot 41 (like in above example) and this moveable has the index = 132, this index will be used for each trigger in triggergroup where you set the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX.
See also description of TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag for more infos.

This is a little example how the TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag work togheter with GT_COLLIDE_SLOT global trigger:
If you type following lines in your script.txt file:

TriggerGroup=	1, $5000+TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX, 749, $E
GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_COLLIDE_SLOT, 43, IGNORE, 1	

Lara will kill each BADDY_2 enemy simply touch him.
The number 43 is the slot for BADDY_2, while the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX in TriggerGroup command has been used to substitute the original target of that trigger (it was an Action trigger to kill a crocodile) with the index of moveable found in global trigger GT_COLLIDE_SLOT, i.e. the baddy2 was colliding Lara.
