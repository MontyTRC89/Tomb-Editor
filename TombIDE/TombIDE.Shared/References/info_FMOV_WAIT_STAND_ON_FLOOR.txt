Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
By default, the moving will be completed when the distance supplied in Distance field has been reached.
Anyway, when you set some kind of gravity, and once covered the distance the item is yet above floor, falling down, the stop of moving affects a weird effect: the item will stop in the empty, at some height from the floor.
If you wish avoid this situation you can add the FMOV_WAIT_STAND_ON_FLOOR flag, and the movement will be stopped only when, other that the distance has been covered, the item has reached the floor, falling down.
