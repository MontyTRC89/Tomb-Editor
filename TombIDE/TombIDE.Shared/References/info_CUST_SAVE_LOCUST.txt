Used in Customize script command.

Syntax: Customize= CUST_SAVE_LOCUST, ENABLED

This customize permits to fix an old bug of tomb4 engine: when the locust swarm has been enabled, and player save the game, at reload the locusts are missing.
The reason of this bug is that the Eidos' programmers probably prefered omit the saving of data about the locusts since they are about large and with playstation 1 version it was important reduce the size of savegames.
Anyway now you can save all data about current particle of LOCUST_EMITTER slot, just you add in [Title] (for all levels) or in a specific [Level] section the row:

Customize=CUST_SAVE_LOCUST, ENABLED

Remark:
The savegame will be bigger than about 2000 bytes if you enable the saving of locusts.
