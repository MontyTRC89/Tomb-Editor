Used with Customize=CUST_INNER_SCREENSHOT
Adding this flag to QSF_SIZE you set a true color 24 bits for inner image.
By default, when this flag is missing, the image will be saved at 256 colors in compressed format. 
The RGB images are very better than 256 compressed, of course, but the size of RGB images is very big and if you mix true color with a big size each savegame could reach 1 Mb of size and this is not a good choice because the players very often wish exchange savegames and, a too heavy savegame could be not goods in these exchanges on-line.
