Used in AddEffect command
This light works like a light-spot, i.e. it generates a cone of light following a given direction like the headlight of sidecar.
For this light type it's important the facing to choose the direction of the light cone.
The default facing is that of moveable where you add this effect, anyway you can change this facing using the FADD_ flags in FlagsEffect (FADD_) field.

Remarks: 
- You could have trouble if there is in same time the jeep or boats using headerlight, because this add effect uses the same light resources to generate this light-spot.
- With this kind of light you have to type  a very high Intensity value, about 200.
- You cann't change the standard yellow-white color for spot light.
