Used into Customize=CUST_BACKGROUND command
This flag perform an AND operation between the game scene colors and the color whom you set the ColorRGB ID in Parameter field.
The AND operation returns a darker image with a preponderance of the color you linked with it.
With BKGDF_ADD_COLOR_AND flag, it's better set color numbers with many bit set to 1, like 255, 127, 63, 31 or 15
For example to have the game scene changed with a dominant red color you could use the color:
ColorRGB= ID, 0, 127, 0
Above color, preserve the green tone while clear fully all other tones.
If you don't wish loosing all other colors, you can set some value also in other tones but with lower values:
ColorRGB= ID, 15, 127, 15

Note: This flag works only togheter with BKGDT_INVENTORY type + BKGDF_KEEP_GAME_SCREEN flag since it performs a change on original game scene.
