Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX
Set a central alignment of text typed by user.
The text will be centered inside of rectangle set in Image script command.
Notes: 
- if you omit this flag, the text will be aligned at left
- It's not advisable using central alignment with a blinking caret because, in this case, everytime the caret will disappear, the text will become shorter and the central alignment will move the position, giving the feeling of a text shackering.
