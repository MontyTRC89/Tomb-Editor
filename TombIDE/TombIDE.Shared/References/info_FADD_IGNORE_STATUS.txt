Used in AddEffect command.
By default the add effect trigger will ignore the comand of add effect if the moveable has not yet been enabled in game or if it has already killed/removed.
Anyway in some cirucstance this compute could be wrong and with some special items the result could be to fail the adding effect operation.
If you work with some of these special items (like some pickups) you can add the 
 FADD_IGNORE_STATUS flag. When trng finds this flag it ignores the status of moveable and it will apply always the effect also if item appears invisible or disabled.
