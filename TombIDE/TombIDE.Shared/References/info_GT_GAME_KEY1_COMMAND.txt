The condition is true when the game command (jump, action, look ect) you set in Parameter field, it has been chosen from Player.

You have to type in Parameter field the wish KEY1_.. game command to detect.

You can also type a sum of many KEY1_ constants (see MNEMONIC CONSTANTS list) but you cann't type in this global trigger a KEY2_ constant. If you want detect a KEY2_ command then you should use the twin global trigger GT_GAME_KEY2_COMMAND.

Remarks:
This condition is true not yet the game command has been sent, this means that the command has not been yet elaborated by game engine when the condition is true.
For example if the command is KEY1_JUMP, lara is not yet jumping.
For this reason, if you wish, you can also remove the game command, to prevent that the game engine can receive it, using the flag FGT_REMOVE_INPUT
See FGT_REMOVE_INPUT description for more infos.
