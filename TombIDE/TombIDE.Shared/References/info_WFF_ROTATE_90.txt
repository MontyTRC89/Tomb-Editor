Used in WindowsFont= command.
The text will be turned by 90 degrees in clockwise mode.
Note: there are some limitations for this flag.

- It will work only with single-row string. This means that the further new line characters ("\n") will be ignored.
You should print a single row at once. If you wish print many rows you'll have to print different single row one by one, changing the origin of rectangle in correct way, everytime.

- You have to use a true type font, otherwise the rotation will not work.

- In the rectangle data of Parameters=PARAM_WTEXT command it will be used the (left,top) to set the orgin, and the difference between left and right to compute the length of the text (in vertical since it has been turned) with the computation (right - left = length of vertical text)
