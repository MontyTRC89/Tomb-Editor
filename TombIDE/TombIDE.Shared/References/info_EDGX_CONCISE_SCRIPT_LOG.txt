You can add this flag in Extra field of DiagnosticType command to create a shorter debugging log.
When you omit this flag the log will be very large, with a lot of mexages about false conditions, frame for frame. 
If you find too chaotic this full log you can create a concise log with EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG flag.
