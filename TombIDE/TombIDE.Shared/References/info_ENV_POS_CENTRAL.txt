Please don't confuse this flag with previous 
ENV_POS_IN_THE_MIDDLE.
The ENV_POS_CENTRAL works fine togheter with some 
ENV_POS_STRIP.. field, to set a central position in specific strip you chose.
While the ENV_POS_IN_THE_MIDDLE cann't used with ENV_POS_STRIP because that flag already set exactly the position in sector (at center).
