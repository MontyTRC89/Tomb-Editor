Used in AddEffect command.
This flag rotate (in temporary way) the item of 90 degrees in clockwise direction on vertical axis.

This temporary change is usefull with some particular moveables where the position of the meshes has a different vertical orienting respect than their position in first animation.
You can discover this situation using Wad Merger and verifying the mesh when there is no animation selected respest when it has been selected the first animation.

It's important understand that all FADD_VORIENT... flags are very different than the FADD_ROTATE... flags, since the FADD_ROTATE flags will be used to give an horizontal direction (facing) for those effects moving on some ideal line, like the mist strip or fire strip.
Differently, you cann't change the direction of effects using the FADD_VORIENT flags, but you'll use these flags only when you have to fix the bad vertical orienting  of some moveables (like the jeep for example).
