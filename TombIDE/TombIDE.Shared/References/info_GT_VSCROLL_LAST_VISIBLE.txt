This global trigger will be true when last row of vertical scroll text is fully visible on screen.
Differently from GT_VSCROLL_COMPLETE, with GT_VSCROLL_LAST_VISIBLE the condition is true when vertical scroll is not yet completed but the last row of text entered in visible area of screen.
In Parameter field you have to type the index of NG string used for scrolling operation you want check.
You can use this global trigger to create a chain of different scrolling operations with different size and color of character.
For example you can create a text with a singe row using very big characters.
You'll use this single row as a big title of following scrolling text with littler size of text.
In above situation you can use a GT_VSCROLL_LAST_VISIBLE global trigger linked to title scrolling, to show the remaining text (other scrolling text) when the title is visible on screen. The final effect will be to watch a single long text using different size or color of character but in the reality it will be two different scrolling texts working in same moment.
