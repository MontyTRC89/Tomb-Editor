Used in TestPosition command.
This flag works ignoring the facing of the object but it checks only the facing's Lara.
To understand the situation you have to think about alignment of lara with pole-rope. In this case it's not important the facing of the pole-rope but only that lara is looking to its direction(and the distance).

Since the round facing is very particular there are some special rules and limitations:

* The couple (XDistanceMin / XDistanceMax) and (ZDistanceMin / ZDistanceMax) should have the same values, anyway trng engine will read only the pair (ZDistanceMin / ZDistanceMax).

* The range (HOrientDiffMin / HOrientDiffMax) is the only orienting pair to be verified.

* If you use this flag in a  TestPosition command with an Animation command having the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS flag, the position of Lara will be moved in ideal position but only in immediate way (no sliding or smoothed movement).
For this reason it's better using limited ranges about max / mix distance and DiffMin / DiffMax horizontal orient, to avoid a too jerk movement in game.
