Used in Demo script command.
Used in [Title] section.
With this flag, when a demo of array will be played, if the following demo is of same level, that will be performed, too, and go on for all demos with same level number.
The advantage to use this flag is to avoid the "load-new-level" phase followed by the "come-back-to-title-level" phase, since all single demos of that level will be played in sequence when their level has already been loaded.
