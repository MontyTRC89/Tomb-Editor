Used in ImportFile command.
When you import a file in script.dat using this import type (IMPORT_TEMPORARY) the file will be stored in script.dat only in temporary mode and it will be immediatly exported at start of game.
For "exported" we mean that the file will created newly with original name and (further) folder.
For example if you import a file using following ImportFile command:

ImportFile=1, Help\Start.htm , FTYPE_USERFILE, IMPORT_TEMPORARY

The content of "Start.htm" file in subfolder "help" of TRLE folder, will be imported in script.dat
When the game will be started (for example in other PC where the sub-folder "Help" and the file "Start.htm" are missing) the TRNG (tomb4) engine will create newly a sub-folder named "help" and it will save the file with name "start.htm"

Pratically the temporary import mode works using the script.dat like a simple "container" where store and then retry files to install in trle folder before the game starts.
About advantage and disadvantages of temporary import, the advantage consist to have a raw installer for your trle folder, removing further problem with special files (like .ogg or images) using level manager, while the disadvantage is that there is not most speed in starting of these imported files, since they will be used in game loading them in common way from hard disk.
Remark: there is no limit about the number or the size of imported files in IMPORT_TEMPORARY mode.
