Used in ImportFile command.
If you select as ImportType the value IMPORT_MEMORY, the corresponding file will be loaded directly in RAM memory and it will be used only from memory.
The advantage is that the file will be started more fastly since it will be not required a disk access to find and load it in memory. This could be very important for sound files, where, in some circustances, the access from hard disk could create a little slow down in frame rate of the game.

Instead, speaking about the disadvantages, the most problem is about the usage of RAM memory, and this could be a real problem if you exaggerate to import too much and too big files in IMPORT_MEMORY mode.
For example if you tried to import in memory all audio files of AUDIO folder (from 000.wav to 111.wav) it will be used about 110 Mb of RAM memory only for imported files, then, adding the memory used from TRNG engine and other memory for other level files the risk is to have leak performaneces because Windows will be forced to use virtual memory to do run the game.
It's obvious that this problem changes in according with quantity of RAM memory installed on the current PC, anyway using as medium/low value a PC with 256 MB of RAM, I suggest to limit the total amount of memory imported files to be less than 20 Mb.

My suggestion is to reduce the usage of memory imported files only when it's strictly necessary, i.e. when you want start very fastly little sound files or images.

In other circustances it's better avoid the IMPORT_MEMORY, preferring the IMPORT_TEMPORARY import mode.
See description of IMPORT_TEMPORARY value to compare the differences.
Remark: You can import upto 200 files in IMPORT_MEMORY mode.
