Set as operator for current condition the AND operator.
Note: The TGROUP_AND is currently unused from 1.2.2.7 dll version. To have an AND operator just avoiding to use TGROUP_OR and TGROUP_NOT.

This operator will be keeped also for following condition trigger if no other TGROUP_ flag for boolean operators will be used.
The AND operation is the default operation, this means that, if you don't use any TGROUP flags to set operators in TriggerGroup, all condition will be linked with AND operators.

Example of list of conditions + boolena operators:

  Condition1
  TGROUP_OR + Condition2
  TGROUP_AND + Condition3
  TGROUP_NOT + Condition4

Above list of condition triggers could be read in this way:

if (Condition1 OR Condition2) is TRUE  AND
	Condition3 is true  AND 
	Condition4 is NOT true  
	then ... perform following (non-conditional) trigger sequence
