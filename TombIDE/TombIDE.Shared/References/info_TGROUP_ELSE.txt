Set the start of a ELSE group in current TriggerGroup.
The ELSE is important to perform an alternative trigger when the first condition was false.
For example if you create a TriggerGroup with conditions to load a different level in according with some condition, you can create a TriggerGroup like following:

	Condition1 is true
		Perform trigger "Load level 4" 
	else
		Perform trigger "Load title level"

Above conditional sentence could be use to perform a bonus level (4) only when some condition (condition1) is true, while is the condition is false (else) it will load the title level, to complete the adventure with no bonus level.

You can place one, two or more ELSE in your TriggerGroup, the rule to follow to understand how the TriggerGroup will work, is:

   If first conditions are true: perform first group of non conditional trigger immediatly following the first conditons.
   While if first conditions are false, skip all following non conditional trigger, until to reach an ELSE flag. 
	If some ELSE flag has been found, the parsing will start from that condition/trigger as it was the start of whole TriggerGroup.
The trigger with ELSE flag could be also another condition, and it will be elaborated in usually method: if conditions are true perform following non conditional triggers, while if the conditions are false, skip all triggers upto another ELSE flag.

Using multiple ELSE you can perform different triggers in according with many different conditions.
For example, we could open different doors in according with last number typed in Keypad switch:

   Condition: If KeyPad Value = 1
		Trigger: Open door 12
   ELSE
	  Condition: if KeyPad Value=2
		Trigger: Open door 7
   ELSE
	  Condition: If keypad Value =3
		Trigger: open door 18
