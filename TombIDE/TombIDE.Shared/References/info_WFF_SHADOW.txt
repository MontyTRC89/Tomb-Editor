Used in WindowsFont= command.
If you add this flag in WindowsFontFlags field, each character will have a sort of shadow.
Technically this effect requires to print two times the same text, moving by a bit of pixels the position, and using two different colors.
By default the shadow will be black, anyway you can change the color for shadow using the ShadowColorRgbId field.
The shadow has two targets: create a simil-border to get more visible the text also over multicolor backgrounds, and to realize a 3d effect, where the effective text could seem it was upstairs a wall where the shadow of this text has been casted.
Remark: this effect works fine with bold or ultra-bold characters, while less well with little/light caracters.
