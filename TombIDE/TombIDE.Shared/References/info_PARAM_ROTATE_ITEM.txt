Used as first value in Parameters script command. It baptizes a parameters list as data for rotating of items, moveables or statics.

Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM, IdParamList, FlagsRotation (FROT_), ItemIndex, DirHRotation (ROTH_...), HRotationAngle, SpeedHRotation, DirVRotation (ROTV_..), VRotationAngle, SpeedVRotation, MovingSound, FinalSound

Description of fields:
-----------------------

IdParamList field
-----------------
This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM" command script in trigger window of ngle.
You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM command, 2 for second ect
You have number between 1 and 99.

FlagsRotation (FROT_) field
---------------------------
You can type one or more FROT_ constants linked with + (plus) sign.
See description of FROT_ constants in Reference panel of NG Center.

ItemIndex field
---------------
This is the index of item to rotate, you can read it in yellow frame that appears when you click over some item in NGLE program.
You can choose moveable or static but remember to perform the correct flipeffect in according with nature (static or moveable) of item.

DirHRotation (ROTH_...) field
------------------------------
If you wish have an horizontal rotation you'll type in this field a ROTH_ value to set the direction of rotation (clockwise or opposite)

HRotationAngle field
--------------------
In this field you set the wished horizontal angle rotation.
The unit of measurement for this field is a bit weird but it that used in tomb4 engine.
These are some references:
$2000  = 45 degrees
$4000  = 90 degrees
$8000 = 180 degrees

For example if you want that some object rotates by 90 degrees you'll have to type in this field the value $4000 (or in decimal: 16384)

Remarks: If you set the FROT_ flag for endless rotation the VRorationAngle field will be ignored, since the item will round continuosly.

SpeedHRotation field
--------------------
The speed is a value that will be added to current orientation factor.
The unit of measurement is the same of horizontal or vertical RotationAngle, but in this field you'll have to type value very littler than final angle to reach, of course.

Remember that the value you type like speed will be added to current orienting 30 times for second.

Remark: It's advisable to use as speed values multiple of power by 2. Typying in hexadecimal is easy to remember the good speeds: 
$80 , $100 , $180, $200, $280, $300  ect
If you don't use these values there is the risk that the speed value was NOT a multiple of final Rotation Angle and hence the object could be not exaclty positioned in final position.
To discover if value for RotationAngle and Speed are good, just dividing Rotation by Speed, if you get a result with decimal point the couple of values is wrong.
  

DirVRotation (ROTV_..) field
----------------------------
If you wish have a vertical rotation you'll type in this field a ROTV_ value to set the direction of rotation (forward or backward)
Remark: unfortunately for statics it's not foreseen a vertical rotation, so you can apply a vertical rotation only to moveable items.

VRotationAngle field
--------------------
In this field you set the wished vertical angle rotation.
The unit of measurement for this field is a bit weird but it that used in tomb4 engine.
These are some references:
$2000  = 45 degrees
$4000  = 90 degrees
$8000 = 180 degrees

For example if you want that some object rotates by 90 degrees you'll have to type in this field the value $4000 (or in decimal: 16384)

Remarks: If you set the FROT_ flag for endless rotation the VRorationAngle field will be ignored, since the item will round continuosly.

SpeedVRotation field
--------------------
This field hosts the speed of vertical rotation.
About the values to set see the description of SpeedHRotation field. The speech is the same, but in this case the rotation is vertical.

MovingSound field
-----------------
Optional field. If you wish assign a sound to item while it is rotating, type a number of sound sfx.
Set IGNORE if you don't wish any sound for moving.

FinalSound field
----------------
Optional field. If you wish perform a sound when the rotation is complete you can type a sound sfx sound in this field 
Set IGNORE if you don't wish any sound for final position.
