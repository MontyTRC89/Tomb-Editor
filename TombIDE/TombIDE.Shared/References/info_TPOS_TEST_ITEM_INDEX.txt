Used in TestPosition command
Adding this value in Flags of TestPosition you change the mean of "Slot Moveable" field.
When you use TPOS_TEST_ITEM_INDEX flag, trng engine will consider the value in "Slot Moveable" field like an index of item to check.
You find the index in NGLE program, clicking on wished item, you'll see the index in yellow frame.
The advantage to use an index is to can test a moveable also if it is extern a lara room, while in other case (checking for slot) the testposition detects only items in same room where lara is.
By other hand, the disavantage to use this flag is that, in this way, you cann't detect all object in general way but you have to specify only one item index.
