Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX
This flag will omit, to draw on screen, the keys hit by user.
In spite of this behaviour all valid keys typed by user will be stored in lastInputText variable and LastInputNumber (if only digits).
Usually you'll use this flag togehter with RIB_HIDE_CARET flag and, probably, to manage single key command with RIB_SHORTCUT_KEY flag.
