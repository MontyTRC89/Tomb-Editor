Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
Relative direction with turning.
Setting this flag the item will move forward but its facing will be changed smootly until to be turned by 90 degrees respect its forward movement. With this setting you can move an item to do circumvent a corner of 90 degress that is at his left.
You can set in Extra field the turning speed typing a value that will be added for each frame to current item facing.
The units work in this way:
45 degrees = $2000 
90 degrees = $4000
You can set any intermediate value, of course and, by other hand, it's better setting little values since the value you typed in Extra field will be added to current facing 30 times for second. Reasonable values are in the range 32 / 1024

Note: set only positive values, please. The direction of turning will be set by the given DIR_ value direction. When you set a left turning the turning speed (you typed) it will be subtracted to current facing of item, but you have to type only positive values.
