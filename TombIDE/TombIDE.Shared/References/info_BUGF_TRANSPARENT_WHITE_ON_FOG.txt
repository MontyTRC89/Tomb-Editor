Used with Customize=CUST_FIX_BUGS command
Used to fix the bug in water textures when there is the distance fog enabled in the level. The transparent texture will become full white.

When you enabled this fix the water textures will ignore the fog density.
You should use it when your level has a depth fog, anyway this fix could create some trouble with fog bulbs closed to water.
