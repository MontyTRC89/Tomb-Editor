Used in WindowsFont= command.
This flag force trng to choose a font with fixed pitch charaters.
Theorically it should be sufficent to choose a font name of fixed pitch like "courier" but in the reality, performing some test, I discovered that sometimes windows font procedure prefers choose a different face name font only to reach other parameters like size of font.
To avoid this doubt you can add the WFF_FORCE_FIXED_PITCH flag and the characters will be surely with fixed pitch.
The fixed pitch (all characers will have always same width) is very useful when you want create text tables like in savegame panel.
