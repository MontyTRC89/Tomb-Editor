Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX command
Force Input Box to accept only digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Further letters (a,b,c ect) typed by user, will be ignored.

When you use this flag the user will be able only to type a number (with any digits) and at end , if he validates the input with ENTER, the digits he typed will be stored as number in "Last Input Number" trng variable. In this way, then you'll be able to check that value with other using flipeffect for trng variables.

Notes: 
- If user quits the input box with ESCAPE command, and you used the RIB_ONLY_DIGITS flag, in "Last Input Number" there wil be the "-1" value.
- This flag is uncompatible with RIB_ONLY_LETTERS flag, of course.
- If you omit either RIB_ONLY_DIGITS and RIB_ONLY_LETTERS flags, input box will accept numbers and letters.
- If you omit the RIB_ONLY_DIGITS flag, the "Last Input Number" variable will be not affected by Input Box.
