Permit to change the slot used to store the jeep key.

Syntax: Customize= CUST_SET_JEEP_KEY_SLOT, SlotForJeepKey

The reason to modify the default slot (default slot was number 175, corresponding to PUZZLE_ITEM1)of jeep key, borns when you use jeep and side-car in same level, using the new features added in trng (from version 1.1.8.6).

When you want use side-car and jeep in same level you must:

* Use last version of wad merger (version 1.98.0.103 or higher, released in may 2008), and copy in its installation folder the new "TR4Objects.dat" file you find in Multiple Vehicles sample zip file.
* Copy the jeep slots (jeep and vehicle extra) in common way in your wad
* Copy the motorbike slot in your wad in common way
* Copy the vehicle_extra slot from wad with side-car, to new slot MOTORBIKE_LARA in your wad. 
To perform this operation just you click on [Copy] button (in wad merger) keeping down the key SHIFT. It will be showed a list of all available slots and  at bottom of this list you'll see the slot named MOTORBIKE_LARA, it's the new slot created to host the lara's animations for motorbike.

Performing above operation you can have jeep and sidecar in same level, but there is yet a little problem: the slot used to host jeep key it's the same used to host the object "Nitrous Oxide Feeder" used to enhance the speed of side-car.
Since both above objects (jeep key ad Feeder) are in slot puzzle_item1, there is a conflict. To solve this problem you can use this customize command to set another slot for jeep key, in this way the old slot puzzle_item1 will work only for Nitrous Oxide Feeder, while the key to switch on the jeep will be stored where you wish with this cust command.
For example if you want store the jeep key in PUZZLE_ITEM2 (slot 176) you can type in [Level] section of your level the following script command:

Customize=  CUST_SET_JEEP_KEY_SLOT, 176

or (same result):

Customize=  CUST_SET_JEEP_KEY_SLOT, PUZZLE_ITEM2
