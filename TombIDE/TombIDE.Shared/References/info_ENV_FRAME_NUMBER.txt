When you set in StateId Animation array a specified number for animation current (as negative value) you can specify also the precise frame when the condition will be true.
For example if you want you special animation starts only when lara is performing the frame number 21 of the animation 325, you type "-325" in state-id animation array (last field of Animtion command) and to set the frame 21 just set the envcondition ENV_FRAME_NUMBER while in Distance for env type 21.
