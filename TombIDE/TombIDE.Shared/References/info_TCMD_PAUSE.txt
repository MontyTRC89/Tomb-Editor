Used in TriggerGroup= command.
This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.
Suggested only for script debugging.
With this command you can force a pause in game when this command trigger will be performed.
Only reason to use this chance is to verify (watching the screen) what's happening in game in that precise moment.
The usage in game-play (and therefore, not for debugging purpose) it's possible but a bit weird. If you wish freezing the game and wait a key from player, you have already some flipeffects to show strings.

You have two ways to perform the pause:
Setting in next argument (third value of this command trigger) the number of microseconds for the pause, and, elapsed this time, the game will come back to run, or setting a scan code (you take the value in "Keyboard scancode list" of Ng_Center's reference panel).
When you set a scan code the pause will go on forever, until the user will hit that key.
To recognize scan codes from microseconds you use the sign.
Negative numbers will be seen as microseconds to wait, while a positive value as a scan code to be hit to quit the pause.
