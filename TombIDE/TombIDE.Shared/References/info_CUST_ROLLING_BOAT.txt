Used with Customize = command.
Syntax: Customize=CUST_ROLLING_BOAT, SlotBoat, FlagsRollingBoats (FRB_), SwingingSpeed, PitchingSpeed, RollingSFX

By default, all boats when Lara is not on board are fully still, this is not very normal when there are waves on water surface.
With this customize you can set a swinging and/or pitching movement to get more realistic the boats on the water.
You can use one or more Customize=CUST_ROLLING_BOAT commands in same level section, to have different rolling for different boats if you wish.

SlotBoat field
--------------
In this field you type the slot of boat to roll.

Remark: teorically you could use also a slot different than boats, for example if you created a fake boat in an animating slot and you wish move it in realistic way.

Note: when you set KAYAK for slotboat remember that the rolling will be performed only when the kayak is in most of its part on the water.

FlagsRollingBoats (FRB_) field
------------------------------
You can add two or more FRB_ flags to set the level of the rolling movement.
The most of FRB flags set the wideness of rolling movement for pitching or sliding.
For example using the FRB_PITCHING_HIGH flag the boat will move upper the peak about the water surface than the FRB_PITCHING_LOW flag, where the peak will move only a bit over the water surface.

See the description of FRB_ constants for more infos

SwingingSpeed field
-------------------
The swinging rolls the boat for the waves hit the boat on the sides.
If you don't wish any swinging type 0 in this field.

The speed value to type in this field works like degrees but in a specific format of tomb4 where 90 degrees = $4000.
You have to type not too exagerate values because this value will be added (or subtracted) by current facing 30 times for second.
Reasonable values are enclosed in the range $08 / $100 (or, in decimal: 8 / 256)

Tips: 
* When you set a LOW value for swinging it's better reduce also the swing speed to compensate the reduction of "distance" covered in the swinging. 
* Normally the swinging is less visible than pitching because the shape of the boat is slim, for this reason it's better set higher values for swing speed.

PitchingSpeed field
-------------------
The pitching rolls the boat for the waves hit the boat on the peak
If you don't wish any pitching type 0 in this field.

About the values to type read the description of SwingingSpeed field

RollingSFX field
----------------
You can type in this field the number of some SFX sound.
This sound will be played when the rolling is to max value, creating the effect of boat touches other boats or the water surface refalling down.
If you don't wish any sound type IGNORE in this field.
