Used with Parameters=PARAM_SHOW_SPRITE script command.
You add the FSS_ANIMATE flag to create an animated sprite where a sequence of spriters will be showed to create the effect of the animation.
You use the Extra Value field to customize the animation.
The number to type in Extra Value is given from the formula:
FrameDurate * 256 + NumberOfSprites
Where:
FrameDurate is the number of frame that each frame will remain on the screen. 
NumberOfSprites is the number of sprites that forms the animation.
For example if your animation uses 8 sprites from the index = 4 and you wish that the animation had the max speed, where each sprite will remain on the screen for only one frame, you should type 4 in SpriteIndex field, while in the Extra Value you should type:  1*256 + 8 = 264 ($0108)

Remark:
There are two kinds of sequence:
Standard sequence, where the indices will grow upto the max and then it repeats from the min index. Like: 
123412341234 
And the for-back sequence, where the index reached the max will be decreased upto coming back to min: 
1234321234321
If you wish use the for-back sequence you have to add the FSS_ANIMATE_FOR_BACK flag
