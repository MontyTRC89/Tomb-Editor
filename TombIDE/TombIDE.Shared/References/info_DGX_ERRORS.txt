Used in DiagnosticType script command.
By default the trng engine is able to give many error messages when it detects some problem with script commands, wrong indices of moveables (in some trigger) and other directx stuff.
Unfortuntaley the most of level designers ignore them because to see these messages they should launch the tomb4_log.exe program (in the "tools" subfolder of trle) and then, at end of the game, show the log that has been caught from the logger.
Perhaps it's a bit boring this procedure, anyway now you can in easier way having the error messages showed on game display in real time if you add the DGX_ERRORS flag to the DiagnosticType command.

Note: since in the game session the errors could be so much to cover all the screen, trng uses a buffering method: it will keep on the screen an error messages only for five seconds, and more, it will ignore when a new error message is the same it had already printed on the screen in the past.

At end of the game, you'll find also a text file named "error_parsing_log.txt" in the trle folder, with all error messages.

If, at end of the playing, you don't find any "error_parsing_log.txt" file this means there have been no errors, of course.

Remark: some error messages could be very long. To remain all in the screen you should use very little font.
Anyway in the error_parsing_log file you'll fine all errors with no truncation.
