Used to store the circle data to use with a fragmented triger

Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_CIRCLE, IdParamList, xCenter, yCenter, Radius


IdParamList field
-----------------
You define an univocal id number, different than others Parameters=PARAM_CIRCLE in same [Level] section.

xCenter and yCenter field
-------------------------
In these two fields you type the center of our circle. Remember that the origin of current squared game sector is (0,0) and it is in top-left corner.
The coordinate of the game square go from 0 to 1023.
The X axis is in NGLE view the west-east direction, while the Y axis go from North to South.

Tips & Tricks: you can place the center also outside of current game sector but the effect will work only inside of current game square.
A reason to place the center outside it could be when you wish having only a very light bend. In this case, if you wish, for example, having a light bending in south-side of current sector you could set the center of the circle in the sector at south of current sector, so let say, at (512, 1600). Then, to have some zone in our sector we'll set a big radius like radius = 800

Note: you can use also negative numbers for the center, and it will be necessary when you wish place the center outside and in a sector at west or at north of current game square.

Radius field
------------
The radius use game units, too. So a circle centered in current square sector, to cover all side will have a 512 value as radius.
