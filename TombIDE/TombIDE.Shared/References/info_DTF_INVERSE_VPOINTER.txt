Current flag works only in pointer mode.
You can invert the position of line in vertical scale (at right of detector)
By default (when you DON'T use this flag) the floating line shows where is lara, while the fixed red pointed line at center shows the position of target.
If you think it's not logical this relation you can use this flag to invert the situation. With the DTF_INVERSE_VPOINTER flag the floating point is the vertical position of target, while the fixed red line is the vertical position of Lara.
