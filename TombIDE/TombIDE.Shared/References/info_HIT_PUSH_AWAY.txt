Used with CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES customization.
The enemy will be pushed away from the bike. When the bike was very fast the enemy will fly for some distance.
The distance and speed of pushed enemy will depends from many factors: the speed of the bike, the angle of impact and the size of the object. When the object is bigger it will be moved to a shorter distance.
Remarks:
You can use this flag also with moveable that are not enemies. For example you can use it with animatings.
About the usage with  other special moveables you should take care about the possible results.
If you use it with pickups you could have trouble to pickup those items after the pusing away because their position will be not at the center of the sector.
A similar speech is for pushable objects: if they lose the alignemnt with sector grid lara could be not more able to push them in common way.
About the rollingball, it will be activated about in the direction of the impact but aligned with hortogonal directions.  Note that the activation of the rollingball with HIT_PUSH_AWAY flag will work indifferently by the OCB codes you typed in the rollingball. Another effect that the HIT_PUSH_AWAY flag will have on already activated rollingballs will be to injury lara when the rollingball is yet moving in an collisional direction.
