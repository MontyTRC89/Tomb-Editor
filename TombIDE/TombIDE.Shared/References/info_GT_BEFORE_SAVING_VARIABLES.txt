Used in GlobalTrigger= command.
This global trigger will be enabled an instant before trng engine saves the variables in savegame or in HUB section (used when lara steps to new level with a finish trigger).
In the Parameter field you type the level number where perform this trigger.
It's important set the correct level number because some operation to save and restore, you could have to do only on some levels but not on oters. 
For xample if you did some variable poke to modify a moveable in level 1, it's important you save its value in a specific variable, different than you could do in oter level 2 where this moveable could be missing.
Remember that the store variables are all global variables and they will be changed and reloaded for all levels.

You can use this global trigger to save in variables some value typed previously to change moveables or pyhsics of the game.
This operation it will be necessary only when your "poke" operation in some critical memory  it's only temporary and it will be lost when player reload a savegame. In this case you have to use this global trigger to save in some variables the changes, and then restore them with other global trigger: GT_AFTER_RELOADING_VARIABLES
