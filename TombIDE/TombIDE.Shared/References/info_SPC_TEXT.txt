Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
This command will draw the extra ng string whom index you typed as argument.
Example:

SPC_TEXT+23

It will draw the extra ng string with index = 23.
About this command it's important remember the flipeffects F399/400/401 whereby those you can set only once at start the position and color of texts for each actor, in this way in the speech commands you can simply set the string with SPC_TEXT command and it will be drawn with color and position for the actor linked with this speech command.
Note: all texts will remain on screen until you don't set another SPC_TEXT command for same actor, or when you use the syntax:

SPC_TEXT+0  

The string with index = 0 will be read as "remove previous text and do not print any string for current actor"
You can also omit the +0 argument, of course.

SPC_TEXT 

with no string index supplied has same meaning.
