Used to restore old behavior of CD trigger.

Syntax: Customize=CUST_SET_OLD_CD_TRIGGER, ENABLED/DISABLED

Using new bass sound engine the CD trigger changed its behavior. 
The looped sounds play on channel1 while the single-shot cd (track number less than 105) play on channel2, letting on channel 1 the previous audio track.
If you don't want this method and you prefer restore old default method you can set following command in your [Level] section:

Customize=CUST_SET_OLD_CD_TRIGGER, ENABLED

The old method played always all CD trigger sounds on channel1 and when a single-playback sound stop the previous looped audio track, when this new single-playbakc sound was complete, the last looped audio tracked was restored always on channel1 from start.
