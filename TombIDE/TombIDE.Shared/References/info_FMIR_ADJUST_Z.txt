Used in MirrorEffect command
You can add this flag to the index of an animating when the reflex of the item has a bad position. This could often happen in the floor mirror when the animating has not the pivot at the center of the mesh but in a corner or over a side.
This problem happen very often with the doors.

When you use this flag the engine tries to analyse the collision box of the item and then to adjust the Z coordinate of the reflex.

Note: the z axis is in west/east direction in the ngle view.
