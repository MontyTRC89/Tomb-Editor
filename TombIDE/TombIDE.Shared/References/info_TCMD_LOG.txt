Used in TriggerGroup= command.
This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.
Used only for script debugging.
With this command you can enable or disable the log, like you had changed the script command:

DiagnosticType= DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS, EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG

In next value, third argument, you'll type ENABLED to enable the log, or DISABLED, to disable the log.
Please note that this command is not able to enable/disable the diagnostics but only the DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS flag.
This means that you should use it in this way:
Type in [Options] section of the script the commands:

Diagnostic= ENABLED
DiagnosticType= 0, EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG

note: you can also type some other DGX_ value instead by inserting "0". Anyway the point is that you omit to insert the "DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS" flag.

Then, in the triggergroup whose you want have the log, you'll type as first trigger:

	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_LOG, ENABLED
and at end of the triggergroup (if you wish) you can disable the log:
	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_LOG, DISABLED
In this way you can remove most of log messages about script commands whose you are not interested, to clean up the log.

Note: this command cann't remove the system log messages, about loading level, creation of lights ect. It affects only log messages about script commands.
