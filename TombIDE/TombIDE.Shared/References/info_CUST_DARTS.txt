Used by Customize= command.

Syntax: Customize=CUST_DARTS, IdCustDarts, Dart Flags (DRT_ ...), IdAddEffect, Speed, EmittingTimer, PrimaryColorIDRgb, SecondaryColorIDRgb, IdTriggerGroup

With this customize you can change speed and color of darts. Someone believes the darts are not visible but in the reality they are not very well visible only because they are too fast. Just you reduce the speed and change the color to see them very well.
With this customize you can also restyle fully the dart: using some add effect or using them like a laser sensory ray. 

IdCustDarts field
-----------------
Differently by other customizations you can set two or more customize profile for dards and then enable in same time one or another typing in OCB field of dart emitter object the IdCustDarts value to locate the customization to use.
For example if you create a command like:

Customize=CUST_DARTS, 3, ....

When you want customize in NGLE a dart emitter with these settings just you type in OCB field of this emitter the number "3"

Remark: the IdCustDarts value should be always greather than 0 becuae the 0 in OCB field will be read with the mean of: "no customize for this dart emitter"
