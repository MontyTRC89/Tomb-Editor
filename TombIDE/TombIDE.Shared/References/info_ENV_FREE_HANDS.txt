Animation will be started only while Lara has no object in her hands.
If she's taking, weapons, crowbar or she is hanging on wall (climb or monkey) the animation will be NOT performed
Note: this flag ignores the flare, since when lara has in her hand only the flare the game engine considers lara with free hands.
