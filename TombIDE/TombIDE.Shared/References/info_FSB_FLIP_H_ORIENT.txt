Used in StandBy command.
This flag do sliding the horizontal orienting of camera in a range from -45 degrees to +45 degrees.
Remark: this setting could be used only with portrait mode, since it should have no sense using it with a matrix effect, since the matrix changes continuosly the horizontal orienting byself.
