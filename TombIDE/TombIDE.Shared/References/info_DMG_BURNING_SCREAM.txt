To use only with DMG_BURNING_DEATH flag.
If you set the DMG_BURNING_DEATH flag you can set also this flag to force lara to scream when she takes fire.
Remark: this flag works only with indirect bar, because when indirect bar is not set, lara burns and dies immediatly and so she has no time to scream.
