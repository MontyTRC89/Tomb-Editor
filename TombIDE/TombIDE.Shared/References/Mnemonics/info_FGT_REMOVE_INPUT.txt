Used in GlobalTrigger command.
This flag works only with GT_GAME_KEY1_COMMAND, GT_GAME_KEY2_COMMAND or GT_KEYBOARD_CODE global triggers.
If you add in Flags field the FGT_REMOVE_INPUT flag, when the condition is true, the just received game/keyboard command will be removed and game engine will be not able to detect it.
In this way you can filter or redirect some game command.
The filtering is when you discover when a given game command has been received and you add (with your triggergroup of globaltrigger) some further actions in according with that command.
The redirection is when you want remove fully the effect of that game command and you want replace them with other your effects.
