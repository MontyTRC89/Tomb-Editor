Used by Customize= command.
Syntax: Customize=CUST_TR5_UNDERWATER_COLLISIONS

Adding this customize in your level you enable the collision method used in tomb raider chronicles about the underwater collisions of Lara.
The difference respect the tr4 collision is that, in tr5 engine lara, Lara will be not stopped when she touches a wall, but she will move or rotate going on in better direction.
Differently in tomb4 any contact will stop lara.
