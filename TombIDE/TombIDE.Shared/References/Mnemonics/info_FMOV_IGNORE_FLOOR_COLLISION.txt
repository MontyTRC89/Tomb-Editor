Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
When the movement affects a new direction or speed or gravity mode (new management from 1.2.2.7 version), by default the engine will forbid to the item to "sink" in the floor.
This means that when you set a UP/DOWN direction or a gravity mode that move downward the item, when it will reaches the floor it will be stopped.

Also with horizontal movement, if the item reaches a point of floor that is higher of its position, the engine will move upward the item to stand over the floor.
Anyway if you wish that the item was able to sink in the floor you can add the FMOV_IGNORE_FLOOR_COLLISION flag and the engine will not perform any control about floor collision.
