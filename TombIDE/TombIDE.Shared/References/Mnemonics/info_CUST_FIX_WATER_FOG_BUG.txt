Used to fix the bug in water textures when there is the distance fog enabled in the level.

Syntax: Customize=CUST_FIX_WATER_FOG_BUG, ENABLED/DISABLED

When you enabled this fix the water textures will be ignore the fog density.
You should use it when your level has a depth fog, anyway this fix could create some trouble with fog bulbs closed to water.
