Set the hair look of young lara in angkor wat.
The only reason to use this value is when you wish to have young lara with all weapons.
To realize this target you should follow this list:
1) Type in corresponding [Level] section these two commands:
Customize=	CUST_HAIR_TYPE, HAIR_TWO_PLAITS
Customize=	CUST_DISABLE_SCREAMING_HEAD
2) DON'T type any YoungLara= command, otherwise lara will have no weapons, while we want that the engine believed that lara is adult lara.
3) Start wad merger and load in left side your main wad, that you are using for your level. It's important that this level had all slots for adult lara.
4) Now load in right side the wad angkor.wad.
5) Copy ONLY these two slots: LARA_SKIN and LARA_SKIN_JOINTS

Now your level will have the young lara with all weapons, flare and crowbar animations working correctly.
