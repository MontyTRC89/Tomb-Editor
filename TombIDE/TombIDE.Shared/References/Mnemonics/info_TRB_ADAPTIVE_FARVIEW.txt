Used in Turbo command. TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW enable a complex compute to adapt the max far view (really the level far view) in current level in according with current performances.
Pratically, when TRNG discovers that it is not able to keep the medium value of 30 FPS (Frame per second), it will reduce progressivly the level far view until it get newly the 30 fps (really you can change the value of frame rate to keep typying a value in FPStoKeep field). When it reaches optimal frame rate and keep this good result for three second, it will try to increase level far view very slowly until to reach the value for levelfarview you set in script.dat file.
This method allows to have a variable distance to show far objects to preserve always good frame rate performances.
Remark: the TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW setting could not work fine togheter with TRB_ASYNC_FRAMES setting, because this last setting creates an irregular response in internal frame rate value and, since TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW uses own the frame rate value to perform the changes in far view, it could be confused by TRB_ASYNC_FRAMES
Remark2: If you mean use TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW it's advisable don't exagerate about setting of LevelFarView in this level.
Many level builders set LeverFarView=127 only because 127 is the max value but this number is uselessly huge, since it's very seldom you have more than 60 sector visible in direct line to watch. By other hand, setting 127 the adaptive job will be slacked because when it'll happen a bad frame rate the engine will spend much time to decrease far view from 127 sector to really meaningful value like 20 or 30 sectors. Same speech for inverse operation, when the far view has been reduced drammatically, not just the frame rate will go on newly the engine will spend many time to increase newly the far view until 127 sector.
For this reason I suggest as ideal values for adaptive farview to set LevelFarView = (about) 60 while the required fps to keep set (about) to 24 fps.
