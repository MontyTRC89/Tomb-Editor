Used in Image= command.
By default the image will be loaded from disk in same moment it should be drawn on screen.
This operation requires sometimes some instant and the game remains froze for that short period.
To avoid this stop you can force trng to preload the image while it is loading other data of current level (when you see the loading bar on screen)
In this way the image will be already in RAM memory and it will be displayed immediatly.
Remark: since the bmp images could be very heavy (one MB or more) it's advisable don't exagerate with the number of preloaded images for same level. I suggest to remain in the complessive limit of 15 Mb of preloaded images in same level.
Differently the size of images preloaded in different levels is not cumulative since trng will discard them when a level has been discarded, of course.
