Used in AnimationSlot command
This condition detect if in front of current moveable it's missing the gray boxes used in NGLE to stop the moving of enemies.
In the DistanceForEnv field you set distance to check in front of enemy.
Note:
The _NO_BOX_ conditions should be used with AnimationSlot command on some enemy. The usage with Lara is theorically possible but not very useful.
