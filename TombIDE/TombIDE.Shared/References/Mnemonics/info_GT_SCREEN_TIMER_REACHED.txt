You can start your global trigger when screen timer reach the supplied number of seconds. You have to type the number of seconds in following field named Parameter.
For example, to start your trigger when timer screen reach 240 seconds (4 minutes) you can type: "GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_SCREEN_TIMER_REACHED, 240, ..."
Remark:
* For this global trigger is strongly suggested to use flag FGT_SINGLE_SHOT, otherwise it, when the condition becomes true,  will performed 30 times for second, forever.
