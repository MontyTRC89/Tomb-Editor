Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
This command will simulate the shaking head to show the feeling to say: "no, I don't...", "it's not true" ect.
You can set two values with this command:
- The speed of shacking movement
- The angle in degrees of the head turning, computed for each side.

To add these values you have to use following formula:

SPC_HEAD_SHAKE + Speed * 64 + Angle

Speed value is the turning increment given in degrees. Each increment will be added at each frame.
For instance to have a shacking of 20 degrees at speed of 3 degrees for frame you'll type:

SPC_HEAD_SHAKE + 192 + 20

Where, 190 is 3 (degrees) * 64 and 20 is the angle for a single side.

Note: remember that for both arguments the max value is 63.
