Used in TestPosition command
In the reality this flag affects the (furhter) alignemnt phase when you used the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS constant in the Animation command that called this TestPosition command.
When you use an Animation command and you used also the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS, when Lara is in a good position for TestPosition command, she will be moved in perfect ideal position before performing the animation.
Well, in some circustances the old method used to move lara byself in ideal position had a problem of continuos loop when she was too closed to target position to reach.
To solve this problem you could use in TestPosition command the TPOS_FAST_ALIGNMENT flag, and in this case Lara will be moved very fastly in correct position avoiding the risk of looping.
Remark: you should use the fast alignment only when you set a very low tollerance in TestPosition command, i.e. when the condition of testpostion will be true when lara is really very closed to ideal position.
