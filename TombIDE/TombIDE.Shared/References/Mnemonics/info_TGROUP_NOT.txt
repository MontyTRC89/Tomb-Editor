Set as operator, to link current condition with previous conditions, the NOT operator.
The NOT operator could be read as "AND NOT" because requires the previous condition was TRUE and that the current condition was NOT true.
You use the NOT operator to invert a condition, this is very useful to create condition not yet presents in trigger condition list.
For example if there is in trigger window the condition "Lara collide with object <#
" but it's missing the inverse condition "Lara is NOT colliding with object <#
", you can use the condition for collide and then add a TGROUP_NOT flag to first value of that exported condition to transforme it in "Lara is NOT colliding with object"
See description of TGROUP_AND flag to have more information about the usage of boolean operators in TriggerGroup.
