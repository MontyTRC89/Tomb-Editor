Used in Equipment command.
If your equipment command is working on a weapon slot (weapon, not ammo), you can add to the Amount field the LOAD_AMMO_TYPE1 flag to set that the ammo is currently loaded with normal ammo (ammo type 1)
Remark: pistol, revolver and UZI can use only ammo type 1. For Shotgun the ammo_type1 is the normal ammo.

Example:

Equipment=SHOTGUN_ITEM, 1+LOAD_AMMO_TYPE1
To set that the shotgun will be present in the inventoy and the loaded ammo will be normal ammo.

If you omit the ammo type currently loaded in the weapon, the engine will use as default the ammo type 1 for that weapon.
