Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command
This flag works only for custom bars (BAR_CUSTOM1/2/3/4)
If add this flag to FBAR field of customize command, everytime the bar will be showed the engine will draw also the wished text under the bar.
The texts to use are prefixed:

BAR_CUSTOM1 : Extra NG String with index = 301
BAR_CUSTOM2 : Extra NG String with index = 302
BAR_CUSTOM3 : Extra NG String with index = 303
BAR_CUSTOM4 : Extra NG String with index = 304

For example if you add a text for BAR_CUSTOM1 you have to add the FBAR_SHOW_BAR_NAME flag in customize command for BAR_CUSTOM1 and the in Extra NG list add a text like this:

301: Jumping Power

Removing the previous index showed when you click on [Add string] button.
