Used into Customize=CUST_BACKGROUND command
This flag works only togheter with BKGDF_MINIMAL_LOADING_TIME flag.
If you use BKGDF_MINIMAL_LOADING_TIME flag, the background for loading level will be kept on screen until the time you set, in spite the effective loading of level could be already completed.
If you wish that the player was able to skip in advance the background and go to next level, you can add the BKGDF_SKIP_LOADING_TIME flag and player will be able to skip the background with escape, space or action (ctrl, really) key.
Note: in background image, when you use this flag, you should add a text to inform player about this chance, pasting in the image a text like "Escape to skip" or other with wished command.
