The snow will be showed in all outside rooms, ignoring multistate button. This means that also a room without "snow" button will have the snow if it is different than Water room and it has the [O] outside status.

Remarks:
(1) If you use SNOW_ALL_OUTSIDE setting, and you want set the intensity for snow in all level, you can set a single room with "Snow" attribute in ngle and set in that room in water intensity field the value for snow intensity. That value will be used for whole level.

(2) If you don't mean to use snow rooms in current level it's better use command "Snow=SNOW_DISABLED" to inform trng engine to avoid a lot of computes to locate further snow rooms.
