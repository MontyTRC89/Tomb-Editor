Used in Demo script command.
Used in [Title] section.
If you wish that the player was able to launch himself the demos, choosing between different demos, you can add the DEMF_PLAY_ON_KEY flag.
In this situation you should also type a textinfo string to explain to the player what keys he can press.

Note: The keys are always digits, from 1 to 0, where 0 is for 10.
If you created demos in three levels of your adventure, you can use as textinfo string one like this:
"Hit "1","2", or "3" to show demos."
The number of the key is not for the position of Demo Id in arraydemo fields, and neither directly the Demo ID, but it is the level number whom a demo will be played.
If you had more than one demo for that (chosen) level, the choice will depends by the further DEMF_RANDOM or DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE flags.
As general rule, trng will avoid to show twice a demo already shown and it will give the precedence to demos not yet played.
