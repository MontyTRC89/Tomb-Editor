Used with Parameters= command
Syntax: Parameters= PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH, SpeechId, SpeechFlags (SPCF_...), Parameter, FrameRate,  SpeechSlot, HeadSlotMesh, FirstMeshIndex, SpeechMeshAmount, CommandArray

The data of PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command will be used to change in sequenze the head of current actor (set via action trigger) to simulate talking.

SpeechId field
--------------
Set here a progressive number to idenfity current PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command to choose with action trigger.

SpeechFlags (SPCF_...) field
---------------------------
You can add one or more SPCF_ flags to customize the talking effect
You can type IGNORE to omit flags.
See description of SPCF_ flags in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section of Reference panel.

Parameter field
---------------
This field could store an optional value working in according with some SPC_ flag.
See description of SPCF_ flags to discover what you can type in Parameter field

FrameRate field
---------------
For frame rate we mean the ration between animation of the head (swapping of heads to simulate animated face) and the number of frames.
Pratically, the default framerate is 5. If you type IGNORE in this field this means you don't wish change frame rate and it will remain the default value: 5 frames for each head type.
If you type 6, each different head will be keeped for 6 frames.
Therefor if you wish slow down the moving of the mouth you have to increase the frame rate, while to increase the speed you have to reduce the frame rate

Note: the framerate value will affect only those speech command where you have not set (or it's not possible) the number of frames to keep that head.
The other speech commands, where you set the number of frame, will be not affected by frame rate field.

SpeechSlot field
----------------
You type here the slot name (or number) from where take the different heads to simulate talking.
All further heads will be taken from following meshes.
You can use different slots, each of them with only an head mesh (old method), or from a single slot with many head meshes (new method).

HeadSlotMesh field
------------------
In this field you type the index of mesh corresponding to the head of actor.
With lara it will be 14, for Jean Yves is 18, for Von Croy is 21 ect.

Note: when you use SPCF_OLD_SPEECH_SLOTS method, this HeadSlotMesh index will be the same of FirstMeshIndex field, while with new method the FirstMeshIndex value could be any you wish, and it will be very often 0, if you place first speech mesh in first mesh of speech slot.

FirstMeshIndex field
--------------------
In this field you have to type the index (the same format you see in Animation Editor of wad merger) of the first mesh for talking in SpeechSlot object.
For instance, if you use old format (SPCF_OLD_SPEECH_SLOTS flag) the mesh index for lara will be 14, because this is the index of head of lara in LARA_SPEECH_HEAD1/2/3/4 slots.
Differently, if you use new method (omitting SPCF_OLD_SPEECH_SLOTS flag), the index should be 0 for lara, while for other actors it will be the index of first talking head for the wished actor.

SpeechMeshAmount field
----------------------
In this field you type the number of different heads used to simulate talking.
Please, remember that this amount is different than number of different heads you can store, furtherly to simulate expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised ect.) The expression heads will be used with direct command SPC_MESH and they should be not counted in the SpeechMeshAmount value.
For instance, if you use the commons Head_speech_lara1/2/3/4  you'll type 4 in SpeechMeshAmount field.

CommandArray fields
-------------------
From this field you can type a serie of different values divided by commas.
Each value is a command and it will have a SPC_ (SPeech Command) value with (+ sign) some value to set relative mesh number or number of frames, in according with speech command used.
The general formula is:

SPC_ command + Frame*64 + MeshIndex

Where:
- Frame is the number of frames to show current mesh. Range for frame is 1 / 63. If you don't set this value (letting 0), it will be used the framerate value as frame durate.

- MeshIndex is the relative index, beginning from first speech mesh of given slot. Range for meshIndex is 0 / 63

Above formula could have some exception (like it happens with SPC_HEAD/LOOK/PLAY commands.)

See description of different SPC_... commands to know the right syntax for each command.
