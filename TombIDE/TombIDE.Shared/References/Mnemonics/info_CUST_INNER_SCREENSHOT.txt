Used to enable the saving of game image in all savegames
Syntax: Customize=CUST_INNER_SCREENSHOT, QualityScreenshotFlags (QSF_...)
When you use CUST_INNER_SCREENSHOT in a level section, in all savegames will be saved also a little image of current game image.
This option will be used by TRLM2009 to see image corresponding at all savegames, and also for new savegame panel to set the quality of inner images.

QualityScreenshot (QSF_...) field
--------------------------------
You can set  in this field two QSF_ flags. One QSF_SIZE_... flag and (optional) a QSF_TRUE_COLOR  flag.
About the settings to use for inner screenshots you should decide if you want a good quality but with also a big size of savegame, or a low quality with a little savegame.
See description of QSF_ flags in Reference panel for more infos.
