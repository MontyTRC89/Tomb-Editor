Used in Customize command.
Syntax: Customize=CUST_HARPOON, HarpoonFlags (HRP_...), TopBorder,DistanceFromCam,Orient_X, Orient_Y, Orient_Z, HarpoonSpeed, HarpoonGravity

This customize enable the change of Crossbow to get an Harpoon weapon like tomb raider 3 adventure.
To use this customize it's necessary also you copy in your wad file the
CROSSBOW_ANIM slot you find in harpoon.wad (you can find it in http://www.trlevelmanager.eu/ng.htm in Source Sample section).
That slot has been changed with the original HARPOON_ANIM get from Tomb Raider 3 level.

HarpoonFlags (HRP_...) field
----------------------------
You can add one or more HRP_ flags to enable specific settings of new Harpoon gun.

TopBorder field
---------------
Adjust the position of harpoon moving up or down in 2d view.
If you want move  up the harpoon decrease this number, while if you want move down the harpoon increase this number
You can type IGNORE in this field and it will be let the default value =0.

DistanceFromCam field
----------------------
Distance from (virtual) cam
This argument  is  useful to increase or reduce the size of object in inventory.
If you increase the distance the object will become more little
If you decrease the distance the object will become more big.
This value is in game units (1 square = 1024 units)

You can type IGNORE in this field to let the default value: $400

Orient_X, Orient_Y, Orient_Z fields
-----------------------------------
These 3 fields set the orientation of cam on X, Y and Z axis.
It's complicated to explain but if you try to change this value you'll understand what I mean.
The values for this argument could be go from $0000 to $FFFF but usually will be used only four values:

$0000 = North (top view)
$4000 = East (right view)
$8000 = South (bottom view)
$C000 = West (left view)

You can type IGNORE in these fields and it will be used the default values:
Orient_X = $B000
Orient_Y = $C000
Orient_Z = $C000

HarpoonSpeed field
------------------
You can change the speed of harpoon.
If you type IGNORE in this field, it will be used the default value, that it is different in according with current inclination respect to the ground.
Reasonable values for this field are enclosed in the interval 100 / 300.
The spees will be different when the harpoon travels in air or in water.
The speed in water will be a 1/4 less than value used for air.
For example if you type 200 in this field, the spees in air will be 200, while underwater it will be 150

HarpoonGravity field
--------------------
The gravity is an increent to move the harpoon down, to simulate the gravity.
The value you type will be used in different way in according if the harpoon is moving in the air on in the water.
When the harpoon is in the air it will be used the original HarpoonGravity value.
While when the harpoon is travelling in the water the gravity will be divided by 2 before using it.
For example if you type in this field the value 16, the gravity in hair will be 16, while in the water it will be 8.
If you type 0 in this field the harpoon will be no affected by gravity force.
You can type IGNORE in this field to let the default value (24).
