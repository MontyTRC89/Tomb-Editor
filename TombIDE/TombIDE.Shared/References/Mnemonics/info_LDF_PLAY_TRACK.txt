Used in Diary= command
If you wish a new background music for Diary, you can use this flag adding to it a value in the range 0 - 255 to choose the audio track of AUDIO folder to play.
For example, if you want have as background music the audio track 104.wav (or 104.mp3/.ogg) you should type in DiarySoundFlags of Diary command this text:

LDF_PLAY_TRACK + 104

Remark: the LDF_PLAY_TRACK flag doesn't stop the game audio track but it overlaps the wished new audio track for diary. For this reason it could be useful, when you use the LDF_PLAY_TRACK flag, add to LDF_PLAY_TRACK flag also the LDF_SILENT flag to stop temporary the game audio track:

LDF_PLAY_TRACK + 104 + LDF_SILENT

Remark: when the diary will quit, the previous audio track of game will be restored
