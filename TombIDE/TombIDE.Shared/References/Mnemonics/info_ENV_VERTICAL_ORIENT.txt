Very particular flag.
You can set a condition in according with current vertical orienting of lara.
Normally lara has always zero like vertical orienting but in some animation this value could change.
You can set a condition about current vertical orienting using the condition ENV_VERTICAL_ORIENT and setting in "Distance for env" field the range of orienting values computed in this way:
MinValue + MaxValue * 256
Typing in hexadecimal value it's more easy to understand. For example if you want set a range like  from 3 to 8, just type $83
The values are 16, from 0 to 15 moving in clockwise direction.
Remark: if you want crate a range enclosing the zero (0) you have to invert max and min value, looking the values like hours on the clock.
For example to enable range accepting following values: 13, 14, 15, 0, 1, 2, 3  you have to type 13 like min value and 3 like max value, i.e. in hexadecimal should be: $D3  (D = 13)
