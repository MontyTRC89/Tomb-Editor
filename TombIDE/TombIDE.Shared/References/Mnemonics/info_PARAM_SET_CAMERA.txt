Use to store information in Parameters command to use with FlipEffect to change temporary the camera mode.

Syntax: Paramaters=PARAM_SET_CAMERA, IdSetCamera, Flags (FSCAM_... ), DistanceCam, VOrientCam, HOrientCam, SpeedCamera

IdSetCamera field
------------------
This is an univocal identifier to locate these parameters in your [Level] section using this value in flipeffect trigger to set temporary a new camera mode.

Flags (FSCAM_... ) field
------------------------
In this field you can type one or more FSCAM_.. flags to affect the behavior of this command.

You can type IGNORE if you don't wish any flag.

DistanceCam field
-----------------
This is the distance of camera from lara.
A reasonable value could be +1600

For more infos about the concept of "cam distance" see the description of CUST_CAMERA

If you don't want change this value you can type ignore, and it will be used the standard distance value set for "chase" (follow-me) camera.

VOrientCam field
----------------
Degrees difference of camera computed on horizonal line (parallel to floor) between camera and Lara.
See the CUST_CAMERA description to read more infos about Vertical Orientation field.

If you wish you can type IGNORE in this field and the engine will use the standard VOrientCam value set for "chase" camera.

HOrientCam field
----------------
Set the horizontal oriantation (facing) of camera respect to lara.

See the CUST_CAMERA description to read more infos about Horizontal Orientation field.

If you type IGNORE in this field the engine will use the HOrient value set for "chase" camera.

SpeedCamera field
-----------------
This value set the speed of camera to pass from previous camera mode (and position) to current new postion.
The speed works in opposite way: big values = slow movements, little values = fast movementes.

If you type little values the camera will reach fastly the new position but the movement could be move jerkily and it's not good to see.
If you type a big value the camera will have a more soft movement but to reach the wished position will require more time.

A reasonable value for fast moving is 1, while for slow movement is 10.

If you type IGNORE in this field the engine will use the default speed value (10).
