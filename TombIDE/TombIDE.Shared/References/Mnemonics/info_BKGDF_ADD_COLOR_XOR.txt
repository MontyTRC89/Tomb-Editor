Used into Customize=CUST_BACKGROUND command
This flag perform a XOR (exclusive OR) operation between the game scene colors and the color whom you set the ColorRGB ID in Parameter field.
This flag creates a result similar to a abstract artwork, where all colors will be exchanged in chaotic way.
Anyway, since each original color will be always replaced always with the same (new) color, the scene will remain understandable but with weird colors.
With this flag it's better using numbers with many bits, like 255, 127, 63, 31, 15
If you wish invert only a color tone you can let to 0  other tones and in this way these will be no changed.
For example to change only red tones of original game scene you can use as color:
ColorRGB= ID, 255, 0, 0

Note: This flag works only togheter with BKGDT_INVENTORY type + BKGDF_KEEP_GAME_SCREEN flag since it performs a change on original game scene.
