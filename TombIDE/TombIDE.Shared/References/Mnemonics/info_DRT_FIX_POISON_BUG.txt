Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command
In default Tomb4 there was a bug about poisoning with darts.
While the poison of scorpion and harpies worked correctly with the screen deformation and lara losing HP, the poison of dart remained only an instant and it was immediatly removed.
If you want fix this bug to get a real poisoning of lara just you add the DRT_FIX_POISON_BUG flag.
