Used in Customize command.
Syntax: Customize=CUST_SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE, SecondsOfDurate, FrameGap, QualityScreenshotFlag (QSF_...)

This command should be used only in temporary way since it could slow down the game.
By default when you hit F3 key (or "." key on US keyboards) the game save the current screen in an image file with progressive names "shot1.bmp", "shot2.bmp" ect.
Using the CUST_SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE setting you can have a long serie of captured frames instead a single image like in the past.
This feature is useful when you wish find the best image in a very fast action in the game.

SecondsOfDurate field
---------------------
In this field you can set for how much time the capture sequence will work.
For example if you type 3 in this field, the screens of game will be captured for 3 seconds continuosly.

FrameGap field
--------------
If you want reduce the number of captured images you can set in this field an interval in capture phase.
If you type 0 in this field, the game will create images for each frame (so, no gap in this case)
If you type 1 it will be captured one frame each two.
If you type 2 it will be captured one frame each three, ect.

QualityScreenshotFlag (QSF_...) field
-------------------------------------
Another reason to capture a sequence of images is to show to some friend a dynamic action without using a movie.
In this situation, sending many images via internet it's advisable reduce their size.
If you type in this field some QSF_ value, you can reduce the size or the quality (omitting the QSF_TRUE_COLOR flag) of the captured images.
Remark: differently, if you want get a full screen image with max quality you should type IGNORE in this field.
