Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
With this command you can do a pause with a closed mouth of the actor for the given frames.

SPC_PAUSE + FramesOfPause

For instance:

SPC_PAUSE + 45

With above command the actor will remain mute (closed mouth) for about one second and half (45 frames)

By default the number of frame is the durate of the pause but you can use also SPC_PAUSE to align speech commands with demo frames of current demo is playing.
In this case we speak about "absolute" frame (while the durate is a "relative" frame, i.e. relative to current demo frame + the durate you set).
To force an absolute frame you have to add to the argument also the special constant "DEMO_FRAME".

For example:

SPC_PAUSE+DEMO_FRAME+136

Above command means: "wait until the demo frame counter reachs the 136th frame.
In this way you are sure that next command will be performed at demo frame 136.
The DEMO_FRAME constant is very useful to syncrhonize speech commands with current demo.

notes:
- Please note that with this command the valid range of pause durate value (relative or absolute) is 1 / 2047
- In the case you use absolute pause (using DEMO_FRAME) but that demo frame was already elapsed there will be no pause and the next command will be immediatly performed.
