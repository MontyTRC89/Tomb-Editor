Used with Customize command
Syntax: Customize=CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES, Slot+HIT_ flag array
This customize allows to choose what will happen when the bike collide with some specific slot.
In the past, the bike killed all mortal enemies, while with those they were immortals it passed across them like they were made of air.
From 1.2.2.5 version there is a new collision management where you can choose what enemies will be killed, what pushed away, what hurted ect.

You use the HIT_.. flags to set the behavior of impact with that slot item.

For example if you wish that the SKELETON was killed you can type the command:

Customize=CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES, SKELETON + HIT_KILL

you can also place two or more flags:

Customize=CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES, SKELETON+HIT_KILL+HIT_PUSH_AWAY

in above case, the skeleton will be pushed away and killed in same moment

You can customize many slots in the same CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES command.
example:
Customize=CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES, SKELETON + HIT_KILL, KNIGHTS_TEMPLAR+HIT_PUSH_AWAY

Note: if you omit to place the CUST_BIKE_VS_ENEMIES customization the default behavior will be this:

			HIT_PUSH_AWAY, // SKELETON
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY, // GUIDE
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY, // VON_CROY
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY , //SETHA
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY, // MUMMY
			HIT_WALL, // SPHINX
			HIT_WALL, // HORSEMAN
			HIT_WALL, // SCORPION
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY, // JEAN_YVES
			HIT_WALL, // KNIGHTS_TEMPLAR
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY, // MUTANT
			HIT_WALL,  // HORSE
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY | HIT_HURT, // DEMIGOD1
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY | HIT_HURT, // DEMIGOD2
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY | HIT_HURT, // DEMIGOD
			HIT_PUSH_AWAY | HIT_HURT,  // AHMET
			HIT_WALL, // LASER_HEAD
			HIT_WALL, // LASER_HEAD_BASE
			HIT_WALL,  // LASER_HEAD_TENTACLE
			HIT_HURT, // HYDRA

While all other enemies will be killed at firt impact.

Note: you can not use the HIT_HURT for immortal enemies, but you can use HIT_KILL+HIT_EXPLODE flags and they will be killed whereby an explosion.

See all HIT_ flags in the Reference panel of NG_Center for more infos.
