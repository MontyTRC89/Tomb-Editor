Used in WindowsFont= command.
A bold character has a big "heavy" layout, pratically the depth of drawn is bigger than normal or light character.
If the background, where the text will be showed, is not solid tint, it's better use a bold or ultra_bold character otherwire in some combination of text color - background color the border could be not well visible.
