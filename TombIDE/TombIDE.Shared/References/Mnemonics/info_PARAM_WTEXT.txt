Used to store parameters to print string with font of Windows

Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_WTEXT, IdParameter, Flags (WTF_...), WindowsFontId, TimeDurate, Left, Top, Right, Bottom

IdParameter field
-----------------
You type an id to identify this parameters command when you'll link it with some trigger to print windows texts.

Flag (WTF_... field
--------------------
You can type one or more WTF_ (Windows Text Flags) flag.
You can type IGNORE in this field if you wish omit flags.

WindowsFontId field
-------------------
This is the ID of some WindowsFont command where you set font and some settings to use in this printing.
Note: it's better that the WindowsFont command was placed first (above) of current Parameters= command.

TimeDurate field
----------------
Here you type the number of tick frames (one tick frame = 1/30th of second) that the text will be showed on the screen.
If you type IGNORE (or -1, that is the same), the text will be showed forever. In this case you'll have to call another trigger (F364) to remove the text when you wish.

Left, Top, Right, Bottom fields
-------------------------------
When you print using windows text you have to identify a bounding box in the screen where the text will be aligned in according with the alignment flags you set in the linked WindowsFont command.
The values are in microunits, where 1000 is the max width or height of screen.
For example the box:

0 , 0, 1000, 1000

Bound all screen, and this setting is good for a long, multiline central alignment.
You can use the [Get Screen Frames] in the [Tool] panel of NG_Center to compute the zone where show/align your text.
This work is very alike than that you used in Diary, with a page to text showed in an ideal box of the screen.
