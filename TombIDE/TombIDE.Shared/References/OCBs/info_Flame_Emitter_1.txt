Flame emitter 1 may burn and kill Lara.

-2 or -7: it shots continuosly the flames in horizontal, following the direction of the cone. Apparently these two ocb values have the same result.

{Negative numbers different than -2 or -7}: it shots in horizontal the flames, but, differently by -2 or -7 ocb, in this case there is a time intervals betwen a shoting and the following shoting. The different negative values have the only usage to have different ejection time when you place many flame emitter and enable them in same time. For example if you type the same negative OCB in two flame emitter, like the number -5, and you enable them in same time, they will emit the horizontal flame in same time. While if you place two different negative ocb, like -5 and -8, the two emitter, in spite to be enable in same time, they will have a different timing about shoting flame and pause time.

{Positive numbers} = Apparently the positive OCB values have no effect on shape of flames, anyway these value will be really used in a misterious way, changing the enabled raising blocks in according with "Scaled Spike". This is the result I got studying the code but it will be necessary some experiment to understand in that way the ocb in flame emitter 1 influences the raising blocks on this misterious "scaled spike".
The only sure thing, is the positive ocb values don't modify directly the flames. Other important suggestion is to don't type never number greather than 7, because otherwise will be passed over the array from 0 to 7, about the raising blocks with unpredictable results.
