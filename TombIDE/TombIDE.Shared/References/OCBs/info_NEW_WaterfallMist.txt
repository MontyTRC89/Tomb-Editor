Remark: you can compute the ocb value for this object using the OCB Calculator you find in Tools2 panel of NG_Center program. Using that tool is very easy compute the correct OCB value.

By default the WATERFALLMIST emitter doesn't accept OCB values but in TRNG engine you can add some ocb to set different features for mist emitting.

Remarks: 

* If you let "0" in OCB field you'll use the old default mist emitter.
* Please, don't confuse the waterfallMIST with the WATERFALL1/2 objects. The emitter is a red cone in the ngle, while the waterfall1/2 are effective objects with a scrolling texture applied on them.

The formula to compute the value to type in OCB field is a bit complicated since there are different values to sum in this way:

(NumberOfBalls-1) + EmitMode * 4 + (SizeBall-1) * 16 + (EmitDurate-1) * 256 + ColorIndex * 4096 + CenterSquare

To understand the meaning of above values read following descriptions:

NumberOfBalls value (Default=4)
-------------------------------
You can have different emitting sources for mist: from 1 to 4.
In default tomb4 the value was the max: 4
These mist balls are aligned on a line to cover about the side of one sector.
If you don't wish a line (or a so long line) but only a shorter zone you can reduce this number, 1 or 2 for example.

EmitMode (Default = 0)
----------------------
This value set the frequency of emitting phase.
There are 4 preset emitting mode, so the valid range for this value is 0 / 3

0 = Normal Emit Mode. This is the same used in default tomb4. It shows like light spray.

1 = Slow Emit Mode. In this mode there is a longer pause between a emitting phase and the next

2 = Fast Emit Mode. In fast mode the emitting is almost continue and the mist ball has really the layout of a dense ball

3 = Random Emit Mode. In random way the interval is not regular but it changes in random way. This mode could be useful to simulare the mist for waves on the beach or in the rapids.

SizeBall value (default= 12)
----------------------------
The valid range is 1 / 16
This value affects the single size of a ball and also the length of the serie of the balls.
The default value is 12

EmitDurate value (default = 6)
------------------------------
The emit durate is the life time of a single particle.
Most long is the time and more intense will be the mist effect.
The valid range for this value is: 1 / 16

ColorIndex value (default = 0)
-------------------------------
In old mist emiter the color was always the same (light gray), but now you can choose between 8 different colors (range 0 / 7), following this table:

                      R   G   B
0: Light Gray        128 128 128
1: Azure             128 255 255
2: Yellow            236 252  19  
3: White             255 255 255
4: Dark Green         15  93  76
5: Red               255   0   0 
6: Blue                0   0 255 
7: Light Green         0 255   0 

CenterSquare value (default = 0 )
---------------------------------
By default the mist line will be showed not at center of the sector but on the side closed to base of red cone.
If you wish create mist own in the center of the square you should add the value 32768
So, pratically the CenterSquare could have like values: 

0 = when you want put the mist line on the side of the sector
32768 = when you want let the mist line at center of current sector
