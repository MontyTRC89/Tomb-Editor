Old OCBs
--------
The standard OCBs for scorpion are not very useful because they should work linked with a internal cutscene.
Placing a value in the range 1/6 the scorpion looks for a TROOP baddy with OCB = 1.  If it finds the Troop, its AI will be disabled and it could be manipulated with custom animations to simulate the fighting with the scorpion. 

OCB 33 (Attack only Lara)
-------------------------
A new OCB has been added to force the scorpion to attack Lara (and only Lara).
By default, in fact, the scorpion tried to attack all baddies it finds, and only after killed them, it will attack Lara.
Typing 33 as ocb in the Scorpion it will attack only Lara ignoring other baddies.
