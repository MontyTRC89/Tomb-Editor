The OCB in animating will be used only when you use an ACTION trigger to move animating.
In this circustance the OCB value will be used as speed for movement of animating.
About the value to type you should remember that 1 sector are 1024 units, and the value you'll type will be added 30 times for second to current coordinate.
For example if you type like speed the value 40 the animating will be moved of 1200 units (40 x 30 fps) for second, and this distance is a bit bigger than one sector.
Remark: If you let 0 in OCB of animating the default speed used by "move animating" trigger will be of 30 units.
