It can be deathable if you enter a high enough value in the OCB data field...somewhere around 96 is the limit.
OCB code defines the number of locusts.
OCB values used in the last revelation were: 12, 20 and 25

Remark:
Locust swarm can set heavy triggers in motorbike path or release a swarm from a shatter object.
