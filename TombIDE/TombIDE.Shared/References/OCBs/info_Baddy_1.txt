Baddy 2
1 = Roll Right. He rolls about a block so this is good for triggering as Lara comes up to a doorway 
2 = Jump Left. As above 
3 = Ducked 
4 = Climb up 4 clicks. Make sure the origin of the baddy is 4 clicks below the block he's about to enter
10 += To give to baddy unlimited ammo

You can set a sequence of baddyes (type 1) adding number 1000 for first baddy, 2000 for second ect.
In this way the second baddy will be activacted only when first baddy will be killed.

1000 += set as first baddy
2000 += set as second baddy
ect.

Same method could be used for baddy 2 but in this case you should use multiple of 100:
100 += set as first baddy 2
200 += set as second baddy 2
300 += set as third baddy 2

Remark: if you want create two different enemy sequences in same level you must create an "hole" value bigger than 1000 (or 100 for baddy_2)
For example:
We say you want then baddy 1 (that we named it "Bob") had other two enemies that will appears when he will be killed.
We will set OCB for first sequence in this way:

Baddy_1 "Bob" with ocb 1000
Other baddy_1 (for bob) with ocb 2000
Other baddy_1 (for bob) with ocb 3000

If we wish have in same room other baddy with other enemies sequence (we will name him "Richard") we should set in this way ocb codes for second sequence:

Baddy_1 "Richard" with ocb 5000 (do you see? It has not "4000" but 5000 eg. +1000 of next value for "bob" baddy_1 sequence)
Other baddy_1 for "richard" with ocb 6000
Other baddy_1 for "richard" with ocb 7000
