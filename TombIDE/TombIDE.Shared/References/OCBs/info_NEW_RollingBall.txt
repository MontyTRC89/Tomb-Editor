Now you can set in OCB field of Rollingball one or more (adding them) of following values:

1 = Silent mode.
Disable sound and earthquake. It is useful to use trick of hidden rollingball to enable more special triggers in sequence, avoiding sound and moving view.

2 = Kill Enemies.
Rollingball will kill all creatures it touches while it is moving.

4 = Active with pushing.
Adding the value 4 the rolling will be activated when lara pushes it.
In this situation it's not necessary place any trigger for rollingball.
With ocb 4 you can place rolling ball also on flat sector (non-sloped sector) just there are slopes on bounding sectors.
In this way lara will be able to choice the direction where move it.

Remark: this ocb requires the Lara's animation 
number 316 in your wad. Not all standard wads have this animation, anyway you may find it in catacomb.wad
If animation 316 is missing in your wad it will happen nothing when lara hits Action closed to rollingball.





8 = Active with pushing and recovery.
This ocb works like ocb 4, but in this case you'll be able not only to engage first time the rollingball but also to move it infinite times from its target position.
Using this method you can move rolling ball also on flat (not sloped) floor, until to reach a new slope where throw it.

Remark: also this ocb require the animation number 316, see above info for Ocb 4.

16 = Destroy shatter objects
Rollingball will destroy the further shatter object on his path.

32 = Check for collision with water room
If your rolling could go in water you can add the ocb 32 to handle:
- Splash on water surface
- Simulation of underwater movements with different pysical behavior.

64 = Enable common triggers. The rollingball, other to enable heavy trigger as default, will enable also common triggers, i.e. the "trigger" usually enabled only by Lara.
In this way a rollingaball will be able to enable traps for lara saving her.
