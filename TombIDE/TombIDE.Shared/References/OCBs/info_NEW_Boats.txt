Boats, rubber boat or motorboat, accetp the same type of OCB:

You can use of following values or a sum of them to enable in same moment different features:

1 = Show lights in front of boat

+2 = The boat will be not able to enable heavy trigger 

+4 = The boat will be not able to enable lara trigger

Remark. For "Lara" trigger I mean the trigger may be activated by lara.

About the value 2 and 4, you could use this limitation to create interesting situations in game: for example you can cover the bottom of a water room with trigger flipeffet:

Lara. Kill Lara in <&>way -> Default death (vitality=0

Using a common "trigger" as trigger type.

Then you set in motor boat the value 
4 (the boat will be not able to enable "Lara" trigger)

More, it's better if you give to that water a dangerous look (like it was lava for example)
Now in game Lara will be killed if she enter directly in that dangerous water, but if she across the water using motorboat she'll survive because motorboat will not enable the common "trigger" on bottom of water room.
This is only an example, other interesting combinations could be created using a bit of fantasy.

+8 = Enable the "look at" feature 

+16 = Set boat as "no fuel". In this situation it will be no possible switch on the boat engine. You can use trng variable triggers to set or clear this ocb in the boat in game time to stop or restore this boat.

+32 = Automatic fuel management. When there is this flag, trng will use the Local Long Delta variable to detect the current value of the fuel. When delta is 0, the boat will be in "no fuel" mode, and it will not work. When the delta has non-zero value, the boat will work. You can use variable trigger to modify the fuel in Delta variable, anyway remember that trng engine will decrease byself the value of delta variable everytime that the engine boat is working.

+64 = Set the boat as "anchored". In this situation the engine will work but the boat will be not able to move away from current position.

+128 = Show fuel bar on the screen. This flag works only togehter with 32 (automatic fuel management). With 128 + 32 ocbs, a fuel bar will be displayed on the screen everytime lara is driving the boat, to show the current level of fuel.
You have to add to the script a "Cutomize=CUST_BAR, BAR_CUSTOM4, ... " command to set the features of the fuel bar.
