Setting "1" in OCB field of the jeep you can enable a beam light for the jeep.
This light works like that of the sidecar, anyway the light cone mesh you see in sidecar is missing on the jeep.
If you wish add this mesh in the jeep you can have the showing/hiding of the new mesh (it has to be the mesh with index = 18) perfmored by trng engine when the light is on or off.
Remark: if you add this new mesh remember to set it like "invisible" at start.
See the sidecar object with Animation Editor to understand better how performing this job.
