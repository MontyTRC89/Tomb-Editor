With ocb values you can set the difficulty for lara to pass the tight-rope.

OCB 0
-----
Set Default mode.
With value 0 it works in same way of TR Chronicles.
In this mode the player has to set the direction opposite to further unbalance of Lara. For example, when lara is falling to right the player has to hit Left command and vice-versa

OCB 1
-----
Set Hard mode.
With value 1 lara could fall if player hits right or left command while lara was in perfect equilibre (while with ocb 0, in default mode, the game engines ignored the futile direction commands)
In Hard mode the player has to set more fastly the correct command and the random unbalance could happen more often.

OCB 2
-----
Set Very Hard Mode.
It works like "Hard Mode" but in this case the rensponse time required to correct the unbalance of lara has to be more rapid than "hard mode".

OCB 3
-----
Set Impossible Mode.
With this ocb lara will always fall down.
The only reason to use this ocb is when you want change in a second time the OCB field using the TRNG Variables.
In this way you could simualte some game dynamic where, for some reason (rain, snow, wind), lara is not able to walk on tight-rope, while then some change (the rain, snow, wind stop) lara will be newly able to pass the tight-rope.
See TRNG Variables triggers working with Item Memory. These triggers begin all with the text: "Variables. Memory. ....  Item Memory ..."

OCB -1
------
Set Easy Mode.

Easy Mode should be used only in adventures for children.
Lara cann't fall down in Easy Mode, just only hit FORWARD direction to reach the end of rope, with no risk.
In Easy Mode is also possible for lara invert the direction, using Backward arrow command, coming back to starting point, while in other game modes is very difficultous reach this target.
