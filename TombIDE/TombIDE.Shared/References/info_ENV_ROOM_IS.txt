Used in Animation= command.
This condition check if current room  (where lara is) is the same of number typed in DistanceForEnv field.
Using this condition you can create a custom animation that it will work only in some room of the level.
If you need to check for more than one room, you should insert the ENV_ROOM condition list in a MultEnvCondition command.

Remark:
In DistanceForEnv you can type the room number you wish check, but you can also write some special constants to verify the type of room, indifferently by its number.
You can type one of ROOM_... constant to test if lara is in that moment in that wished room type.
See description of ROOM_... constants for more infos.
