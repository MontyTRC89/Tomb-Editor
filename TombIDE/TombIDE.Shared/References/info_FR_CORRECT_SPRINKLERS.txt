Used in Customize=CUST_RAIN command.
In default code the elaboration of sprinklers (when the rain drop touches the ground) was a bit leak. If the room had an irregular floor (not flat at same height) many sprinlers were not visible because they were generated under ground.
If you want correct this bug you can add the FR_CORRECT_SPRINKLERS flag.
