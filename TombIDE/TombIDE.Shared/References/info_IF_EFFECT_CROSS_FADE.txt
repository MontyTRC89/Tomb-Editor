Used in Image= command.
The cross fade is when there is a fade out (the screen from normal color becomes black) followed by a fade in (the screen from black comes back to normal light.
The image will be displayed in the black phase.
Note: you cann't mix the effect with other effect like zoom or moving from  sides. 
Neither the transparent flag works fine with cross fade, since when the image will be displayed the tomb raider screen will be black.
The cross fade works only with overlapped images, not with pop up images.
