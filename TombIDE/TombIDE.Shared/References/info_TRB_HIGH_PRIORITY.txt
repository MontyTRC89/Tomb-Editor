Used in Turbo command. TRB_HIGH_PRIORITY set an higher class priority for whole tomb4 process, to increase the time supplied to tomb4 respect to other processes. Theorically this setting could advantage the game engine when in the PC there are other programs are working, or some background services like antivirus. If in your PC there are no other big process this setting will have no visible effect.
