Used to force the hair of lara in game. 

Syntax: Customize=CUST_HAIR_TYPE, HairType  (HAIR_...)

You choose the kind of hair setting an HAIR_  constant value.
You find all HAIR_ constants and their description in Reference panel of NgCenter in MNEMONIC_CONSTANTS list.
Remark: This command is not able to change byself the mesh of hair but simply it used to inform the engine about what kind of hair object you have copied in your wad file.
For example you can use a young lara (get from angkor wat) but don't set in script.dat the command YoungLara=ENABLED. In this way you'll be able to use young lara with correct hair type (using CUST_HAIR_TYPE)and keeping, in same time, also the weapons like for adult lara, because the engine will consider lara as adult lara since you have not type YoungLara=ENABLED.
Pratically, this customize value (CUST_HAIR_TYPE) is useful to divide the setting about hair from that about weapons. If you use old command YoungLara you cann't distinguish setting about hair from setting for weapons, or you choose "two plaits" of your lara but then you renounce also the weapons, otherwise, you choose adult lara and you have the weapons but you'll have always the single ponytail look.
Differently, using CUST_HAIR_TYPE  you can use YoungLara only to set or less the weapons, while you'll use Customize=CUST_HAIR_TYPE  to set the hair style.
