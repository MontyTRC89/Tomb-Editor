Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command
With this flag you replace the given value in IndexItem field with the index of current enemy set as leading actor.
This is an interesting way to use over and over the same parameter=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM to do move different enemies. Just you set as leading actor a different enemy and you can use again the same PARAM_MOVE_ITEM to move also this new enemy.
