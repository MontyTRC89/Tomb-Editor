Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command
When you set in boat ocbs the values: 32 (Fuel management) + 128 (show fuel bar), you have to set a customize script command to prepare the fuel bar to show on screen.
The fuel bar is always the BAR_CUSTOM4 bar.
You can type this customize command as usual, but with two differences:

1) To the flags you have to add the FBAR_USED_FOR_BOAT_FUEL flag.

2) In the extra field of customize, you have to type the max value for fuel, i.e. the value when the boat has a full fuel and it will correspond to full bar on screen.

This value, to type in extra field, works in this way.
The fuel of the boat is, pratically, the number of frame tick for the operating time of the boat.
Everytime the boat engine is working this fuel/time will be decreased by 1 for each frame tick, when it reaches 0, the engine boat will switched off and the fuel bar will be empty.
Please note that, when the boat is running in turbo mode, the fuel will be decreased by 2 units.

Since frame ticks are 30 for seconds, to give as full fuel an operating time of 15 minutes, you should type the value 30*60*15 = 27000

Notes:
- The max value you can type in this field in 65534 that corresponds to 
about 36 minutes. In the game times this is a huge time, probably you'll use a very lower value.
- Remember that the fuel management for boat uses, in hardcoded mode, the local long Delta variable (#0072) to store the current fuel of the boat. You can use this variable to show on screen the remaining time, or, converting it in litres, a representation of current litres in the boat tank.
You can also using triggers to increase or decrease the current fuel.
