Used in SavegamePanel= script command.
By default in central position of first row trng will draw the title of panel savegame: “Load Game” or “Save Game”.
If you want omit this text you can use this flag.
The only reason to omit the title of panel is when you want type some title directly in the background image.
Anyway remember that in this way you cann’t handle the difference between “Load” and “Save” game.
