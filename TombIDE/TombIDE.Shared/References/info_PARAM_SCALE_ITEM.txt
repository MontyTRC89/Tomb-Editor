Used in Parameters= command to store data for scaling effects

Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_SCALE_ITEM, IdScaling, ItemIndex, Flags Scaling (FSCA_...), BeginSizePercentage, FinalSizePercentage, PercentageSpeed

IdScaling field
---------------
Used to locate this specific command in the script.
When you'll use this data you'll have to choose this number in Set Trigger Type window to choose the Parameters with scaling data to use in your trigger.

ItemIndex field
---------------
In this field you type the index of item to resize. You get this univocal index within NGLE program, performing a right mouse click on the item placed in the map. You read the index in the yellow frame in the rounded parenthesis.

Flags Scaling (FSCA_...) field
-------------------------------
Flag to customize the scaling effect.
You can type IGNORE if you don't use any flag.
Read the FSCFA_... values in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section of Reference Panel of NG_Center program to know the different flags you could use.

BeginSizePercentage and FinalSizePercentage fields
--------------------------------------------------
The dynamic scaling effect works changing dynamically the size of an item  from a size to another.
The BeginSizePercentage is the beginning size of the item in the game, while the FinalSizePercentage will be the ending size of the item to complete the effect.
The values are in percentage, where 100 = the original (in the wad file) size of the item.
For example if you wish increase the size of this item from original size to the double, you'll use:
BeginSizePercentage=100
and
FinalSizePercentage=200

Remark: You can type IGNORE in the BeginSizePercentage field only when you use this script command to resize immediatly an item to the wished new size (of FinalSizePercentage field) with no dynamic effect.

PercentageSpeed field
---------------------
In this field you the value  to add (or subtract) at each frame to BeginSizePercentage to reach the FinalSizePercentage value.
Bigger it will be this value and most fast will be the dynamic resize effect.

Important: the value is not given in 100th but in 1000th, i.e. one unit = 1/1000. The reason is that in this way you can set also a very slow speed, while, differently, using effective percentage, you could have only like min speed "1/100" and in this way the min speed of the effect could be too fast.
