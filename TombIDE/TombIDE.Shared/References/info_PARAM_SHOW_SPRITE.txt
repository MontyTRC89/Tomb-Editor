IdParamShowSprite field
-----------------------

OriginX and OriginY fields
--------------------------
In these two field you should type the origin of (top-left corner) the sprite.
Both values are in micro units, so you can use the [Get Screen Frames] tool you find in [Tools] panel of NG_Center program.

Width and Height fields
-----------------------
You have to set the size that the sprite will have on the game screen.
Like for the OriginX, OriginY fields, you have to type these values in microunits, hence you should use the [Get Screen Frames] tool to choose a rectangle on the screen and then copy both four values in microunits in the OriginX, OriginY, Width and Height fields.

Remark: if you wish use a sprite grid (with the FSS_SHOW_SPRITE_GRID flag) please, don't confuse, you have to choose like witdh and height the size of a single sprite and not the final size of the sprite grid.
