Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command
This command will show the simulation of a syllable.
In our convention, we define the syllable like a single animation from closed mouth to max-open mouth or vicevera.
This means that, if actor in the moment of this command, had closed the mouth, the syllable command will change heads from closed mouth to max-open mouth.
In the case, differently, at begin of this command, it had a full opened mouth, the syllable command will show in sequence all heads to do close the mouth.
Pratically the SPC_SYLL command is not a single mesh, but an animated sequence of meshes, from mix to max opening of mouth or viceversa.
If you don't add any value to this command, it will be used the default frame rate, and so, each head of animated sequence will be showed for FrameRate durate.
If you wish having a different frame rate only for this command, you can add the number of frames for each head, mutlplying it by 64:

SPC_SYLL+192

Since 192 means 3 frames (3*64= 192), each head of animated sequence will be displayed for 3 frames.

If you add a value between 1 to 64, it will be the number of syllable to be played with this command.
For instance:

SPC_SYLL+5

It will show 5 animated sequence of syllable. This means that the mouth will be opened and closed twice, and then another single syllable.
