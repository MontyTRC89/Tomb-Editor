Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.
This flag works only when you set also the flag PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE.
Since when the PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE flag is enabled, lara is able to increase the powerness of jump turning many times, you can enable with PB_SHOW_CHARGE_BAR the view of progress bar with current jump power.
It's advisable to add this feature because otherwise the player could have some difficulties to understand how much turns he made until that moment.
