Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.
This flag is very alike than FMV_SHORT_BLACK_RESTART, so read also the description of that flag to have more infos.
This long version of black restart, remains with a black screen for one second after the end of FMV.
There are some reasons to use this long black restart (instead of shorter version).
Some changing in game required a bit of time to be engaged. For example a rope just enabled will have a starting animation, a change of position of lara will require a moving of follow-me camera to look lara correctly.
If the changes you perform after the FMV require some time you can use the long black screen to show to player only final and stable game position.
