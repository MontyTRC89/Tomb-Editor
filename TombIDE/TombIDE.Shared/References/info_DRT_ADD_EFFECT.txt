Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command
I you wish, you can add some effect for each dart
When you use this flag you have to type in IdAddEffect field the ID of AddEffect script command where you set the effect to add to the dart.

Remarks: 
- Warning, this feature could be very cpu intensive. If you have many dart emitters in your level my suggestion is to disable the emitter already visited by Lara, using a Untrigger to free the resource for those no more used dart-emitters.
Another suggestion is to set a big Emitting timer (to slow down the emitting) and/or an high Speed value to avoid having too much darts enabled in same time.

- In the AddEffect command, pointed by IdAddEffect field, some fields will be ignored: DurateEmit and DuratePause, while other fields should have always same value: the JointType should be always set to JOINT_SINGLE_MESH value.
Pratically the engine will be interested only by the type of effect while for the  emitting time it   will be constant for the life-time of the dart.
