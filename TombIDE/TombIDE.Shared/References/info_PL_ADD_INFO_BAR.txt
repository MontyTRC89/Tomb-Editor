Used in Diary= command.
Differently by other PL_ flags, you can add the PL_ADD_INFO_BAR to another (but only one) PL_ flag.
Adding the PL_ADD_INFO_BAR to some other layout you inform trng that in current layout the bottom row of screen should be reserved and no text of diary should be typed over it.
You can use this flag when you want use the bottom strip of background image to show arrows or some short infos about keyboard commands to manage Lara's diary.
Pratically when trng detects this flag, it will format the text avoiding to cover also bottom row of screen, in this way you can dedicate that bottom zone with little icons or info texts.

Remark: the infos you could insert in Info bar are the description of keyboard commands accepted by Lara's Diary:

RIGHT ARROW  = Show next page
LEFT ARROW = Show previous page
HOME = show first page of diary
END = show last page of diary
ESCAPE = exit from Diary
SPACE = Zoom Image (show further little image of page at full screen). Newly SPACE to come back to original size.
