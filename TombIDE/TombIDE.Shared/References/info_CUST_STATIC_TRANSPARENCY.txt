Permit to change the values for transparency of static you can assign to some static with new flipeffect trigger "Static. Transparency. .."
Syntax: Customize=CUST_STATIC_TRANSPARENCY, GlassOpacity, IceOpacity

To set transparence you have really to set the value of opacity. 
The values you can set for GlassOpacity and/or IceOpacity are a percentage where:

0 % = Opacity is none, the object is fully invisible
100 % = Opacity is full, there is no transparence for object

You should type values different by 0 and 100, of course.
Using 50 % the object and background should have same presence (semi-transparent)
Using 90 % the object is almost normal (full opacity) but there is a lite transparence
Using 10 % the object is almost invisible but you can see it like a ghost.
You can type any value between 0 and 100.
The default values (used if you don't use any Customize=CUST_STATIC_TRANSPARENCY command) are:

Glass = 50 %
Ice = 81 %
Remark: In above examples I used the percentage sign "%" but you don't type it in your script command.
