It simulates the opening and closing mouth with a sequence of heads, in same way you can simulate other expression, like smiling, angrious ect.

- The number of mesh used in this sequence

With this command is not possible set the frame durate of animation, it will be used the default frame rate set.

Formula to type values for this command is:

SPC_SEQUENCE + NumberOfMesh* 64 + IndexFirstMesh

For instance:

It means: the aimated sequence begins from mesh with index = 12 and the mesh of sequence are 4 (4 * 64 = 256)
