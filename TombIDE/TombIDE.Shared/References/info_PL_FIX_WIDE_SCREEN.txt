Used in Diary= command.
When the game was played at full screen on a wide-screen monitor the images of Diary will be distorted and lara will become an obese dwarf.
If you want avoid this deformation you can set this flag. When trng finds the PL_FIX_WIDE_SCREEN flag, it will show the background image of diary non at full-screen but with a width a bit littler than screen to preserve the normal ratio between width-height with a ratio of 1.3 ([width] divided by [height] = 1.3)
In this wieving at left and right of diary there will be two empty columns.
This look could be good if you in background image draw a book style image.
