WEAP_DISABLE_AUTO_SHOT:$0001  ;Disable the repeat function of shooting. By default when the player keep down the action key the weapon will continue to shoot, while, using this flag, the weapon will shot once and the player will have to release the action key if he want shot newly.

WEAP_DISABLE_CHANGE_WEAPON:$0002 ;By default, the game engine will change the current weapon with pistols when the current weaponst runs out the ammo. If you add this flag the change of weapon will be disabled and lara will keep same weapon also when the ammo has been run out.

AMMO_PUSH_TARGET:$0002  ;When the ammo will hit the enemy, he will be pushed (moved) like if the impact of ammo had moved him. You have to type in Extra field the distance of movement. The distance units are 1024 = one sector, 256 = one click. 

AMMO_PUSH_LARA:$0004  ;When lara shots the back stroke will move lara backwards. You could use this flag with heavy ammo like grenade. You have to type in Extra field the distance of movement. The distance units are 1024 = one sector, 256 = one click. 

AMMO_SET_GRENADE_TIMER:$0008 ;To use only with greande ammo. You can change the number of second required to do explode the grenade. The default value is 4 seconds. You have to type the number of seconds in Extra field.

AMMO_ADD_GUN_SHELL:$0010 ;Used in Customize=CUST_AMMO command>It used to add the shell falling down after shooting.>If you use this flag it will be used the mesh of slot GUNSHELL for the shell.

AMMO_ADD_SHOTGUN_SHELL:$0020 ;Used in Customize=CUST_AMMO command>It used to add the shell falling down after shooting.>If you use this flag it will be used the mesh of slot SHOTGUNSHELL for the shell.

AMMO_REMOVE_SHOTGUN_SHELL:$0040  ;Used in Customize=CUST_AMMO command>This flag remove the shell case effect. You should use this flag only for shotgun ammo.


DTF_NONE:0
DTF_SWINGING_POINTER:$01  ;This flag works only in Pointer mode.>By default the pointer points exactly to target, anyway if you want you can add a swinging simulation of pointer like the compass in inventory to get more realistic detector.

DTF_RADAR_MODE:$02  ;This flag set the detector in radar mode. If you omit to set this flag the detector will work in Pointer mode.>There are big differences between two modes and some fields and flags will work only for a specific detector mode.>In pointer mode the detector has a pointer like a compass that shows where is the current target (current target is the first target in the list yet present in game).>Pointer mode works only on one target at time: when the first target has been picked up (or killed) the detector will start to point second target in the list and go on.>In radar mode detector is able to scan all targets in same moment just they are in the range of radar. >Note: Remember that the range of radar is different of range for activation. The range of radar is given by formula 6 * MetricScale, where the digit "6" is the (fixed) number of grid sectors of radar. For example if you set 2 meter for metric scale the target will be showed on radar only when it is to 12 meters from lara or less.>To understand radar mode is bit more difficultous than pointer mode, because the target in radar mode will be showed always with up side = north, while in pointer mode the pointer is always relative to where lara is looking. In fact, in pointer mode, when the pointer is on red sign this means lara is looking in correct direction of target, while in radar mode it's advisable that lara looks to north to understand if targerts are at her left or right.

DTF_ENGAGE_INVENTORY:$04 ;Lara has to pick up the detector object and to engage it it's necessary go to in inventory and select it

DTF_ENGAGE_IN_RANGE:$08  ;the detector will be automatically showed when lara is closed to some target, within the given range (see following fields)>With engage_in_range you can set for example 50 meters and the detector will be showed when lara is to 50 meter or less from nearest target.>When lara will be more far the detector will be hidden.

DTF_REQUIRED_ITEM:$10 ;Detector will work only if lara picked up it, or she has it from start of level in inventory
DTF_ENGAGE_ALWAYS:$20  ;the detector will be always present on screen, at least until some of targets exits yet in the level.

DTF_FAST_RADAR_SCAN:$40 ;The pointer will turn very fast

DTF_INVERSE_VPOINTER:$80 ;Current flag works only in pointer mode.>You can invert the position of line in vertical scale (at right of detector)>By default (when you DON'T use this flag) the floating line shows where is lara, while the fixed red pointed line at center shows the position of target.>If you think it's not logical this relation you can use this flag to invert the situation. With the DTF_INVERSE_VPOINTER flag the floating point is the vertical position of target, while the fixed red line is the vertical position of Lara.

DMG_INDIRECT_BAR:$01  ;If you want have a progress bar on screen to signal the level of current damage in current room it's necessary to use always this flag.>With indirect bar the vitality of lara reamins untouched until the indirect bar become empty (or full if you set flag DMG_INCREASE_BAR)

DMG_ONLY_PAD:$02 ;Lara damaged only while her feet touch the floor of current room. To use for simulation of electric floor or very hot floor.
DMG_INCREASE_BAR:$04  ;By default, the damage bar (showed only using DMG_INDIRECT_BAR) starts full and decrease it until to empty, and when reach the empty status lara will be damaged very fastly.>If you want change this behavior to have a progress bar that it grows, starting from empty to reach full, you must use this flag.

DMG_COLD_WATER:$08  ;Specify you are using current command to set the default behavior of all cold water rooms in current level.

DMG_POISON_LARA:$10  ;Non just lara enters in current room she will be poisoned with deforming effect of screen and life bar with yellow color.

DMG_BURNING_DEATH:$20  ;When the time of damage bar will be completed, lara will be killed burning her with real fire.>To use only for damage rooms waterless.>If this flag is enabled, lara will burns when:>The indirect bar is empty (if indirect bar is present)>The HP bar is empty  (if you don't enabled indirect bar for damage room)>You could use this flag to simulate a room where the temperature grows until burning lara.

DMG_SLOW_DISAPPEARING:$40  ;Set the behavior of damage bar when lara goes off by damage room to reach a safe room. If you omit this flag the damage bar will disappear instantanly, while using the flag DMG_SLOW_DISAPPEARING the damage bar will invert its direction of fulling/emptying and it will disappear only when it reach the full state (like at start of enter-in in damage room)

DMG_BURNING_SCREAM:$80  ;To use only with DMG_BURNING_DEATH flag.>If you set the DMG_BURNING_DEATH flag you can set also this flag to force lara to scream when she takes fire.>Remark: this flag works only with indirect bar, because when indirect bar is not set, lara burns and dies immediatly and so she has no time to scream.

DMG_ALERT_BEEP:$100 ;To use only with DMG_INDIRECT_BAR  flag.>If you set this flag, when the bar will be go down until 15 % (or less) than full value, the bar will blink and a little "beep" sound will be performed togheter with blinking.>Remark: Also when this flag is absent the bar will blink but no sound will be performed.

DMG_LITTLE_TEXT:$200  ;When you use a BarName in your Damage= command, you can choose this flag to to use a little text to show the string with bar name.

NEF_SET_AS_BRIDGE_FLAT:$0020  ;Used in Enemy command.>Force the specified animating to work like a BRIDGE_FLAT item.>You can place below it a dummy trigger and lara will be able to walk over it.>Remarks: >It's advisable using an Animating item with this flag. >In particular way some moveable will not work because they have more than a mesh or a pivot for first frame non compatible to work like bridge item.>A good way to avoid these problems is to copy an original BRIDGE_FLAT object in an animating slot with wad merger (Copy button + SHIFT key to reassign the target slot).>Once you copied the original BRIDGE_FLAT in your object then you can modify its layout with metasequoia.


NEF_SET_AS_BRIDGE_TILT1:$0040  ;Used in Enemy command.>Force the specified animating to work like a BRIDGE_TILT1 item.>The tilt1 is a bit sloped  with a difference by one click between opposite sides.>Remark: see also the description of NEF_SET_AS_BRIDGE_FLAT flag for more infos.


NEF_SET_AS_BRIDGE_TILT2:$0080  ;Used in Enemy command.>Force the specified animating to work like a BRIDGE_TILT2 item.>The tilt2 is a slope with a difference by two clicks between opposite sides.>Remark: see also the description of NEF_SET_AS_BRIDGE_FLAT flag for more infos.

NEF_EASY_HEAVY_ENABLING:$0100  ;Used in Enemy command.>This flag gives to current enemy type the ability to enable any heavy triggers immediatly.>By default only some moveable enable heavy triggers and it's necessary place an AI_ object in target sector where there is the heavy trigger to enable.>Differently, with NEF_EASY_HEAVY_ENABLING flag the enemey will enable all heavy triggers where it moves over.

NEF_SAVE_MESH_VISIBILITY:$4000 ;used for enemy command>If you use the action trigger to get invisible some mesh of a moveable, you sould create an Enemy command for the slot of that enemy, adding the NEF_SAVE_MESH_VISIBILITY flag, to force the game engine to save and restore from savegame the visibility status for each mesh of that moveable.

NEF_SET_AS_SEMIGOD:$8000 ;used for enemy command>Using this flag the enemy will become like a semigod and it will be not possible kill him.


EF_NONE:0
EF_MULTI_DOORS:$0001 ;If you want that trng engine handle for you all doors in front any floor you can set this flag and then set in IndexFirstDoor the index of door at first floor.>The management of game engine is very simple: when elevator reach a floor the door of that floor will be opened.>When elevator leaves a floor the door in that floor will be closed.>If you use this multi-doors handling is important you place all doors in your project exaclty at same vertical distance you set in ClickFloorDistance field. It's important, because is you place some door to different distance that door will be not found by trng engine and you'll have troubles.>Pratically just you place each door at same height where the elevator will stop it, floor for floor.

EF_SINGLE_DOOR:$0002 ;If you use single door mode you cann't set also flag multi-door.>In single door mode the elevator has a single door linked with elevator cage.>This door will be moved up and down in according with elevator movement.>When elevator reach a flor the door will be opened, when elevator starts from a floor the door will be closed.>If you set this flag you have to type in FirstDoorIndex field the index for the door you placed near to elevator.>Remark: you can use also a "fake" door you find in slot Animating2 in ng2.wad>This animating will be moved, sliding it horizzontally, like a door by trng engine if you use single-door mode and you set its index in FirstDoorIndex field.>There is a reason to use a fake door like this: when you use a real door,in fact, in some circustances (it depends by door type and by position of door respect to rooms linking) the engine will add an invisible sector collision in front of the door when it's closed. Since it's boring in many situations you can use the fake animating door to avoid this problem.

EF_INNER_KEYPAD:$0004 ;If you want insert the keypad to choose flor inside the elevator you must set this flag and (in ngle) to place the keypad oriented on wished elevator wall. Then you'll type the index of keypad in InnerKeyPadIndex field.>Remember to use the "fake" keypad you find in Animating16_mip of ng.wad or ng2.wad and not the real keypad in switch_type1.>The reason of this choice is given by a technical problem: the switch_type requires a switch trigger to work, but you elevator floor you have to place also dummy triggers and for this reason it's not possbile place both special trigger in some sectors.>For this reason the management of "fake" keypad (of Animating16_mip) will be performed in hardcoded mode by engine.>Apparentrly the keypad will work in same way of switch_type1 but with no need of special trigger to handle it.

EF_MODE_YO_YO:$0008  ;Yo yo mode is a bit curious: elevator will move endless up and down, without any stop at floors.>Using this mode you cann't use doors, since there is no time to open and close them. >Lara will have to jump at fly in elevator.>An interesting application of yo-yo mode is to give to elevators also the role of trap, since if lara will be touched by elevator she will be killed (if she is under elevator moving down, or over elevator when elevator moves up and above lara there is the ceiling) or "disturbed" if she is climbing the wall when elevator touch her (lara will be untouched by wall)>Remarks:>1) You cann't mix yo yo mode and stop and go mode.>2) If you set elevator for yo you mode the number of floor will be always two (2) and the distance between floor will be the height of whole movement that elevator will cover before inverting direction.

EF_MODE_STOP_AND_GO:$0010  ;Stop and go mode is similar to yo yo mode, but in this case the elevator stop and stay for some second (2 for elevator door less, 3 seconds for elevator with doors) in each floor.>Differently by yo yo mode, using stop and go mode you can place the doors (multi or single) and you can set a various number of floors.>Also stop and go mode may heart lara (like all elevators)

EF_DOUBLE_DOOR:$0020  ;Used in Elevator command.>Please don't confuse this flag with flags like EF_SINGLE_DOOR or EF_MULTI_DOORS.>While those flags say the number of doors to use, if a single door to move up/down with elevator, or multiple door, one for each floor, the double door specify the TYPE of a single (or multi) door, and then this door could be a single_door or a multi-door.>The double door is a door composed by two (separated) doors.>For this reason the double door is able to cover two sectors of width, like the width of elevator.>The reason to use this flag is to have two different door opening in same moment when the elevator reach a floor, to be able to cover whole width of elevator.>This flag has been added own to get above target and it requires some attemption to work correctly.>If you set the EF_DOUBLE_DOOR flag, it's necessary that the secondary door had always a ngle index higher by 1 than main door.>>I explain better:>>For "main" door we intend the door that has the index you type in Elevator= command.>While the "secondary" door is the other door (paired to main door) to open/close in same moment of main door.>This secondary door has to have an index exaclty +1 of main door.>For example if your main door at first floor (in a multi-door elevator) has index = 23, the secondary door should have an index  = 24 (+1 of main door).>If this rule will be violated the double door will not work in game.>>If you have problems to get two consecutives indices you could use this simple trick:>Place a door in some free zone of your room, this zone is not in front of elevator, it will be only a "store" temporary zone.>>Continue to place doors in this zone, checking the index assigned from ngle for each new door.>When you get two doors with consecutive indices, delete these two doors, and now place the two doors in correct position in front of elevator. In this moment you can place also other double doors for other floors of elevator (if you are using multi-door elevator).>When you completed the placement of the double doors you can come back to temporary zone and delete all no useful doors you placed to realize this trick.>>Remark: if you are using like "single-door" an animating door (just place like door any animating with correct collisions) the behavior of this animating door will be different in according with usage or less of the EF_DOUBLE_DOOR flag.>If the EF_DOUBLE_DOOR flag is missing the animating door will be moved (sliding) in internal direction, i.e. the door will be opened moving the door over other panel of elevator.>Differently, when you use EF_DOUBLE_DOOR flag, the two door will be opened with external movement: the left door will be moved furtherly to left,  while the right door will be moved at its right.>Also for animating doors you have to use the rule of consecutives indices: the secondary door should have the index of main door + 1.>In the case of animating double doors it's also important that the two doors should have same orienting (facing).>Another rule about animating doors is that the door you have to set as main door (the index you type in Elevator command), it should be always the door at left of elevator, looking the elevator from door side. This last rule it's not important when you use real doors.


FAN_KEYS_AS_SCANCODE:$0008  ;If you mean to use KeyBoard scan code in Key1 and Key2 fields, you have to add this flag  FAN_KEYS_AS_SCANCODE in FAN_ fields.>When you don't use this falg the value typed in Key1 and Key2 field will be interpreted like Game command, i.e. mnemonic constants KEY1_.. and KEY2_...>Remark: This behavior is the opposite respect for first version of Ng_Center. In previous versions you have to set a flag to specify to use game commands but now the game commands are the default setting.

FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS:$0001  ;The current flag FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS perform a specific action to inform game engine that the hands of Lara are free and, since, she will be able to hang, climb and pick up objects or weapons.>Remark: this operation to free hands will be performed ONLY if your special animation will be really started.>>You should use this flag only when you special animation starts from a position where lara had busy hands (she was climbing, or hanged) but, your animation move her from wall and to do jump her. In this situation you have to inform engine now she has free hands, otherwise lara will be not able to graps a climb wall after the jump.

FAN_START_FROM_EXTRA_FRAME:$0002  ;If you want that your animation starts not from first frame (0) but from some specific frame number, you can add the FAN_START_FROM_EXTRA_FRAME falg in FAN_ field, and then type in Extra field the number of frame from what to begin the animation.

FAN_SET_NEUTRAL_STATE_ID:$0004  ;This value forces the engine to change the real state-id number of your animation, replacing it with a neutral state-id.>The advantage is to avoid some interference created by tomb4 engine in some circustances.>You should use this FAN_ value when your special animation was breaked before reaching the last frame, only because lara is in the empty or she has problems with collisions or for status (water, falling, climbing)>When an animation is performed with neutral state id (69 number) the game engine checks only for basic collisions but it doesn't perform any specific controll about what lara is doing and where she is.


FAN_RANDOM:$2000  ;Used by Animation script command.>With this flag you can perform different animation in random way.>You have to type in Extra field the number of random animations.>For example if you want perform one of following animations: 512, 513 or 514, when all condition in animation command are true, you'll have to type in AnimIndex field the first animation 512, while in Extra field you type 3 to inform there is a block of three random animations, starting from animation 512.>When all conditions will be true it will be performed the animation 512 or 513 or 514.>The target of this feature is to create a simulation of random events also in animations of lara. For example if you want create a falling animation you can create different kinds of falling to choose in random way.

FAN_DISABLE_PUSH_AWAY:$0010  ;Used in Animation command.>If you wish that lara did not change her (and the your) animation when she has been touched by enemies, you can add this flag.>The push-away animation is a very hardcoded animation, where lara suspend previous animation and move herself slowly while the enemy is pushing her away.>These push-away animations have numbers: 125 126 127 128>>Note: this flag disables the pushaway animation only when the animation of lara is the same you set in current Animation command.>If you use an animation chain, where, after this first animation, there is another, your custom animation, you could see lara with push-away animation while there is this second animation. To avoid this problem you can use this trick: create another Animation command for the second animation, with the FAN_DISABLE_PUSH_AWAY flag. The trick consists in the fact that this other animation command could be never performed, just using an unexisting stateid as condition for it, but this animation will be however used to store the animation numbers about when disabling push away animation for lara.>>Another method to solve above problem is to disable the push away animation forever and for all lara's animations, with the CUST_DISABLE_PUSH_AWAY_ANIMATION customize command.


FAN_KEEP_NEXT_STATEID:$0020  ;This is a very technical flag.>My suggestion about to use it or less, it's simply to try...>At start you should create an Animation command without using this flag, because it's more common don't use it, but if you see somewhat don't work, you could try adding this flag to see the result.>Technically you should use this flag when your animation is for single execution and then lara will come back to some standard animation.>While you should not use this flag when your animation has to be performed in loop, like an upward jump and many other fluid animations.

FAN_ENABLE_GRAVITY:$0040  ;This flag enable for your animation the gravity compute.>When lara is flying or falling the engine store a flag to remember to apply to lara the gravity rules. In some cirucstances you could need to enable the gravity for your animation using this flag.

FAN_DISABLE_GRAVITY:$0080  ;This flag work in similar way of FAN_ENABLE_GRAVITY but in this case is to disable the gravity compute. >See description of FAN_ENABLE_GRAVITY for more infos.

 

FAN_PERFORM_TRIGGER_GROUP:$0100 ;This flag changes fully the working mode of Animation command.>When you add this flag the value you typed in first field of Animation command, i.e. the field named "AnimIndex", will be seen as an IdTriggerGroup to perform when all conditions set in Animation command are true.>This means you could start you custom animation typing in a triggergroup a flipeffect to start a specific animation of lara, adding in same triggergroup also many other effects, and then to use an Animation command to start the trigger group when player hit correct key and all conditions are true.>In many circustances, other to perform a custom animation, you wish also to perform some special effect to change somewhat in game, in this way you add new skills for lara. >A way to realize this target is to create a custom animation where you set in some frame a NG AnimCommand to perform these "special effects" (i.e. exported triggers to perform somewhat). When animation command start  your custom animation, the NG Anim command of custom animation will be performed and it could perform many changes in game.>Well, using the FAN_PERFORM_TRIGGER_GROUP flag you can get same result but in a different way.>You can create a trigger group with many exported triggers to change some situation in game, and then, in same trigger group, to have also a flipeffect to perform the wished custom animation.>The difference between two above methods is that, using the triggergroup method, you can perform somewhat before the animation will be started, while with NGAnimCommand in custom animation, these effects could be done only while the custom animation has been started.>Remark:>Theorically you could don't add any "perform animation" flipeffect in the TriggerGroup, in this way you'll use the Animation command to perform some operations when player hits some keystrokes.>Anyway you follow this method remember to find a way to avoid the triggergroup was continuously performed a lot of times untile the conditions are true.>TRNG engine uses as method to avoid multiple performing, to disable temporary this Animation/Triggergrop until the key used to perform it first time, remains yet down, but it should be better if you place some trigger in TriggerGroup to change some condition to avoid the furhter repetitions of this triggergroup.

FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS_TEMP:$0200 ;This flag works like FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS but in this case it set only temporary the "Free Hands" status. The previous status (about what lara was hanging) will be restored at end of your custom animation.>The "free hands" it's necessary when you want perform your custom animation while lara holds weapon or torch, in fact, when "Free hands" is missing, the arm of lara will not follow your custom animation.>Another difference about old FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS is that the FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS_TEMP fixes a bug where the "free hands" command didn't work when lara holded Torch. 

FAN_SET_BUSY_HANDS:$0400  ;This flag work in similar way of FAN_SET_FREE_HANDS flag but with an opposite target, of course.>If you use this flag, when your animation will be performed the game engine will be informed that the hands of Lara are now busy and she is not able to grap to wall.>Remark: It's very seldom you'll have to use really this flag, because, by default when your animation has correct state-id (for example for climb or monkey) the game engine set this flag by self

FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS:$0800  ;From version 1.1.9.8 this FAN has new properties.>When you add this flag and you set some valid ENV_POS_... flags in Evironment field (see following description) the position of lara will be forced to be the ideal position in according with ENV_POS_ values before performing your custom animation.>For example if you set ENV_POS_HORTOGONAL, an instat before starting the special animation the lara orientation will be aligned with hortogonal axis.>Remark: by default the alignment operation is a bit poor, since TRNG move immediatly lara in ideal position without any progressive movement. >Anyway from versione 1.1.9.8, when you set FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS in according with ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION condition, you can get a progressive self adjustment in game like you see in default tomb4 when lara open a door or push a pushable object.>This feature will use the data you set in TestPosition command and extracts from it the ideal position to reach, using intermediate values for each difference range you set.>This feature don't work fine if lara was performing a state id different by stand-up position or swimming underwater.>Warning: when you set ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION and the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS the orient information will be read only from TestPosition command, so the further ENV_POS_... FLAGS you add in EnvCondition will be ignored.



FAN_SET_ADDEFFECT:$1000  ;You can add a particle effect when your animation will be performed.>You have to create a AddEffect= script command to specify what particle effect to use. Then you add current flag FAN_SET_ADDEFFECT in FAN field, and you type the number of AddEffect command in Extra field of Animation= command.>Remark: by default the effect will have an infinite durate, anyway you can override this setting using correct flag in AddEffect= command to have the durate of effect only when some stateid or animation number is on.

FAN_SET_LARA_PLACE:$4000 ;Used in Animation command.>This fan flag could be used when your custom animation move lara between two different places, like from "ground" to "water", or vice-versa.>You have to type the new place (where lara should be at end of your animation) in Extra field.>You can type one PLACE_ value in extra field to set the new environment of Lara.>>Remark: when you create an animation to move lara between different places it's very probable you need to add a standard [SetPosition] command to move lara in new position but also to adjust the different pivot position used in according with ground, underwater, floating ect.



PLACE_GROUND:0  ;Used in Animation command.>Lara is on the ground, i.e. she is out of water. For ground we could mean also when lara is falling down, other that climbing, monkey, jumping.>The most signficative description for "ground" is: "not in water"

PLACE_UNDERWATER:1 ;Used in Animation command.>Lara is underwater, please don't confuse this situation with PLACE_FLOATING.>Lara is underwater only when she is under the water surface and she is not able to breathe.

PLACE_FLOATING:2  ;Used in Animation command.>Lara is floating on water surface.

PLACE_SPECIAL:3 ; Used in Animation command.>I'm not sure about this status of lara. Surely it will be used when lara in on some vehicle or when she is in DOZY mode.>Probably this status means: lara is performing hardcoded animations where the physic rules about gravity or water floats will be ignored.

PLACE_LOW_WATER:4 ;Used in Animation command.>Lara is on low water. The low water is when lara touch the water with her feet but she is yet able to walk

EXTRA_TEETH_NO_DAMAGE_ON_WALKING:$0001  ;Used in Enemy= command.>You can enable the no-damage for lara when she moves slowly (walking).>If you set this flag in Extra field of enemy= command with TEETH_SPIKES slot, lara will be able to walk in teeth spikes with no damage.

EXTRA_WRAITH_BURN_LARA:$0001  ;Used in Enemy= command.>When you type an Enemy script command to customize some wraith slot type, you can this flag to enable the burning of Lara when wraith touches some times Lara.

EXTRA_MUTANT_NO_LOCUSTS:$0001  ;Used in Enemy= command.>If you are customizing the MUTANT slot with an Enemy script command, you can disable the swarm locust attack adding this flag in Extra field of Enemy command.


ENV_NO_BLOCK_IN_FRONT:1  ;Perform your special animation only if lara has NO block in front of her face. In "Distance for Env" field you set the height of block. For example if you set 1024 (height of one sector) trng will consider true the condition "no block in front" if the floor in front of lara is higher less than 1024 units respect current floor where lara is. While if floor in front of lara is high 1024 units or more, it will be detected a block in front of lara.
ENV_HANG_WITH_FEET:2  ;To use only when Lara is hanged to wall corner. The condition is true only when the wall where Lara hanged is enough height to host also feet of lara. >In Distance field you can change the height of this wall, the default value is $300  (3 clicks)  but in some circustances it's better to use as Distance a lower value, like $200 (2 click)

ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_IN_FRONT:3  ; condition is true when there is an hole, i.e. a zone where lara is able to go down or fall.>Different ENV_HOLE_FLOOR.. set the position of adiacent square respect that where is lara.>In Distance field you can set the height (or depth) of the hole.

ENV_MONKEY_CEILING:4  ;Condition is true when lara is belove a monkey ceiling.>In Distance field you can set the range of distance of monkey ceiling.>The Distance in this case is different by usual: the formula is:>MinClick + MaxClick * 256>For example if you want that the condition is true when the monkey ceiling is enclosed in range 5 (min) clicks  upto 7 (max) click, you'll have to type in distance field the value (7*256 + 5) = 1797 >Remark: in hexadecimal (with '$' sign) it's more easy understand the Min and max value, for example the number 1797 in hexadecimal is $0705 where you can read the Max click ("07) and the Min click ("05")>>Remark: if Lara is under the monkey ceiling but the heigh is outside of the range you set in distance field, the condition will be false and the animation will be not performed.

ENV_CLIMB_WALL_IN_FRONT:5 ;Condition is true when the specific wall in same sector where is Lara, is climbable.

ENV_CLIMB_WALL_AT_RIGHT:6 ;Condition is true when the specific wall in same sector where is Lara, is climbable.

ENV_CLIMB_WALL_AT_LEFT:7  ;Condition is true when the specific wall in same sector where is Lara, is climbable.

ENV_HOLE_IN_FRONT_CEILING_CLIMB:8 ;You should use above condition only when Lara is monkey on the ceiling and you want create an animation that permits to lara to pass from current ceiling to an heighest climbable wall, passing directly by ceiling to climbable wall.

ENV_HOLE_BACK_CEILING_CLIMB:9 ;You should use above condition only when Lara is monkey on the ceiling and you want create an animation that permits to lara to pass from current ceiling to an heighest climbable wall, passing directly by ceiling to climbable wall.

ENV_NO_BLOCK_AT_RIGHT:10  ;Condition is true only if there is no wall in sector at right of lara.>In Distance (next field) you can type the height of wall. See "Distance for Env field"

ENV_NO_BLOCK_AT_LEFT:11 ;Condition is true only if there is no wall in sector at left of lara.>In Distance (next field) you can type the height of wall. See "Distance for Env field"

ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_RIGHT:12  ;condition is true when there is an hole, i.e. a zone where lara is able to go down or fall.>Different ENV_HOLE_FLOOR.. set the position of adiacent square respect that where is lara.>In Distance field you can set the height (or depth) of the hole.

ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT:13 ;condition is true when there is an hole, i.e. a zone where lara is able to go down or fall.>Different ENV_HOLE_FLOOR.. set the position of adiacent square respect that where is lara.>In Distance field you can set the height (or depth) of the hole.

ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_BACK:14 ;condition is true when there is an hole, i.e. a zone where lara is able to go down or fall.>Different ENV_HOLE_FLOOR.. set the position of adiacent square respect that where is lara.>In Distance field you can set the height (or depth) of the hole.

ENV_NO_BLOCK_BACK:15  ;Condition is true only if there is no wall in sector back of lara.>In Distance (next field) you can type the height of wall. See "Distance for Env field"

ENV_CLIMB_WALL_BACK:16  ;Condition is true when the specific wall in same sector where is Lara, is climbable.

ENV_SUPPORT_IN_FRONT_WALL:17 ;All ENV_SUPPORT_... check for a support where lara could hang in wall in front (or back, left, right)>You can use this condition to start some animation where lara jumps and hang on wall in front of her, to verify if there is a wall with correct height in front of lara.>For example by default the game engine allows to lara to hang to a wall if this wall has an height in range between 4 click to 7 click.>If the wall is heigher (from 8 click respect to lara's feet) lara will be not able to hange with a up jump.>Well, if you want set same condition you have to insert in Distance for Env field this value:  $0174>For ENV_SUPPORT condition the distance env is a bit complex.>The values you have to set are:>The min height acceptable (4 click in our example)>The max height acceptable (7 click in our example)>The minimum space present over the support to place lara hands (1 click)>>The he formula is:  MinHeight + MaxHeight*16 + ClickSPace * 256>In decimal this value is misterious: 4 + 7 * 16 + 1*256 = 372>Anyway if you type in in hexadecimal format is more easy understand the position of each sub-field: 372 decimal = $174  in hexadecimal.>I.e. in hexadecimal the digits are:   >>$0BCA  >>where:>'A' is click of minimum height required>'B' is click of minimum height acceptable>'C' is number of click of space over the support>>About hexadecimal notions remember the numbers, usign a single digit, have following sequence: >0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A (10 decimal), B (11 decimal), C (12 decimal), D (13 decimal), E (14 decimal) and F (15 decimal) >In this way you can set number of click between 0 and 15 click for each sub-field of Distance for env.>>Another sample we could do, it's that to verify if, while lara is hang to support, she has enough space to move up over the new floor.>For this target we'll use a distance like $333 because:>>3 click for min and max height, because the support has to be in a specific position, where are the hands of lara.>The value 3 is the distance from feet of lara, about 3 clicks>The last "3", for space, is the space necessary to host lara in stand up position.>In this way above condition will be  true only if the height of space over the support where lara hanged is at least 3 click of heigth.


ENV_SUPPORT_IN_RIGHT_WALL:18 ;see description for ENV_SUPPORT_IN_FRONT_WALL
ENV_SUPPORT_IN_LEFT_WALL:19 ;see description for ENV_SUPPORT_IN_FRONT_WALL
ENV_SUPPORT_IN_BACK_WALL:20 ;see description for ENV_SUPPORT_IN_FRONT_WALL
ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_IN_FRONT:21 ;Verify if there is an object (moveable) with slot number = number set in ExtraSlot field of Animation command. As DistanceForEnv you have to type the distance where you want the object. (1024 = sector)
ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_OVER:22  ;Similar to ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_IN_FRONT but in this case the object should be over lara, on same sector. In DistanceForEnv you type the height over lara (See description of ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_IN_FRONT for more infos).
ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_UNDER:23 ;Similar to ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_OVER but in this case the object should under lara. If you set the DistanceForEnv field to 0 the object should be near to feet of lara.

ENV_MULT_CONDITION:24 ;Signal a multiple condition. The effective ENV condition flags will be stored in a MultEnvCondition script command, and in DistanceForEnv you have to type the ID of MultEnvCondition command will be used.> The final condition will be true only if all conditions in MultEnvCondition command will be true in same time.>Examples:>>If you want set in your animation command two Env condition, like: ENV_CEILING_HEIGHT with height (distance env) = $300 (3 clicks) + other condition: ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT with depth (distance env) = $400 (4 clicks) you can as first step create this MultEnvCondition command:>>MultEnvCondition= 1, ENV_CEILING_HEIGHT, $300, ENV_HOLE_FLOOR_AT_LEFT, $400>>and then type in Animation command the reference for Id of above MultEnvCondition (1) and the ENV_ condition: ENV_MULT_CONDITION>>For example:>>Animation=447, KEY1_LEFT, IGNORE,IGNORE,ENV_MULT_CONDITION, 1,IGNORE,-445, -448


ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER:25  ;Verify if lara is near to corner at her left while she is hang mode. In DistanceForEnv you type the min distance from corner to be the condition true.>Remark: the "_IN_" means internal corner. The internal corner are that you find inside a box, while the "_OUT_" (outside) corners are them you find outside of a box.

ENV_HANG_LEFT_OUT_CORNER:26 ;Same mean of ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER but with reference to an Outside corner. See description of ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER to have more infos about internal and outside corners.

ENV_HANG_RIGHT_IN_CORNER:27 ;Same mean of ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER but for right side. See description of ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER costant.

ENV_HANG_RIGHT_OUT_CORNER:28 ;Same mean of ENV_HANG_RIGHT_IN_CORNER but for outside corners. See description of ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER costant

ENV_HANG_LEFT_SPACE:29 ;Verify if there is yet space at left of Lara in hang mode. In DistanceForEnv you type the space required at left to have the condition true.>Remark: you can't specify a value for distance that passes over the current sector. If you type a too big value the engine will reduce it to reach only the left border of current sector.

ENV_HANG_RIGHT_SPACE:30 ;Same of ENV_HANG_LEFT_SPACE but for right side. See description of ENV_HANG_LEFT_SPACE for more infos.

ENV_DISTANCE_CEILING:31  ;Condition is true if distance from lara to ceiling is greater or equal to value typed in DistanceForEnv. >For example type in DistanceForEnv the value $300 (3 clicks) the condition will be true if the coordinateY of lara (on her feet when she is stand up) is distance from Ceiling 3 click or more in current sector where lara is.

ENV_CLIMB_LEFT_IN_CORNER:32 ;Verify if lara is near at an internal corner al left. See description of ENV_HANG_LEFT_IN_CORNER constant to understand the difference between internal and outside corners.

ENV_CLIMB_LEFT_SPACE:36  ;Works like ENV_HANG_LEFT_SPACE but it should be used when lara is in climb mode
ENV_CLIMB_RIGHT_SPACE:37 ;Works like ENV_HANG_RIGHT_SPACE but it should be used when lara is in climb mode

ENV_MULT_OR_CONDITION:38  ;Works like ENV_MULT_CONDITION but the final condition will be true if just a single condition of MultEnvCondition command is true.>See description of ENV_MULT_CONDITION for more infos.

ENV_DISTANCE_FLOOR:39 ;Verify if the distance between lara and floor under her is greather  or equal than set in DistanceForEnv field>Remar: if you want the opposite condition, i.e if distance from floor is less or equal than DistanceForField, just you add to ENV_DISTANCE_FLOOR the special flag ENV_NON_TRUE. This method work for all other condition where you want inverte the condition.

ENV_FRAME_NUMBER:40  ;When you set in StateId Animation array a specified number for animation current (as negative value) you can specify also the precise frame when the condition will be true.>For example if you want you special animation starts only when lara is performing the frame number 21 of the animation 325, you type "-325" in state-id animation array (last field of Animtion command) and to set the frame 21 just set the envcondition ENV_FRAME_NUMBER while in Distance for env type 21.

ENV_VERTICAL_ORIENT:41  ;Very particular flag. >You can set a condition in according with current vertical orienting of lara. >Normally lara has always zero like vertical orienting but in some animation this value could change.>You can set a condition about current vertical orienting using the condition ENV_VERTICAL_ORIENT and setting in "Distance for env" field the range of orienting values computed in this way:>MinValue + MaxValue * 256>Typing in hexadecimal value it's more easy to understand. For example if you want set a range like  from 3 to 8, just type $83>The values are 16, from 0 to 15 moving in clockwise direction.>Remark: if you want crate a range enclosing the zero (0) you have to invert max and min value, looking the values like hours on the clock.>For example to enable range accepting following values: 13, 14, 15, 0, 1, 2, 3  you have to type 13 like min value and 3 like max value, i.e. in hexadecimal should be: $D3  (D = 13)

ENV_ON_VEHICLE:42  ;By default the start of animation cann't happen if Lara is driving some vehicle.>Anywya if you want create new animation for lara while she is on some vehicle you have to use this ENV condition and typing in Extra field the Slot number of vehicle. >Remark: In Extra field you cann't type the name of slot but you can type the number you read at left of slot name in Slot moveable list of reference panel.

ENV_FREE_HANDS:43 ;Animation will be started only while Lara has no object in her hands.>If she's taking, weapons, crowbar or she is hanging on wall (climb or monkey) the animation will be NOT performed>Note: this flag ignores the flare, since when lara has in her hand only the flare the game engine considers lara with free hands.

ENV_UNDERWATER:44  ;Perform animation only if lara is underwater
ENV_FLOATING:45 ;Perform animation only if lara is floating over water surface
ENV_ONLAND:46  ;Perform animation only if lara is on land

ENV_FLYING_DOWN:50 ;Perform animation only when lara is jumping and she is in fall down phase

ENV_WALL_HOLE_IN_FRONT:51 ;This condition works in very similar way of ENV_SUPPORT_IN_FRONT_WALL condition, but in this case, other to check for a support in front wall, the engine will check also the height of this hole in the wall, allowing to set the min height and the max height limits of this hole.>>The {distance env} field for ENV_WALL_HOLE_IN_FRONT is like that for ENV_SUPPORT_IN_FRONT_WALL condition, but there is a value in more to set the height of the hole in the wall:  >The values you have to set are:>The min height acceptable (4 click in below example)>The max height acceptable (7 click in below example)>The minimum space present over the support to place lara hands (example 1 click)>The max space present over the suppot (height of hole) (example 2 clicks)>>>The formula is:  MinHeight + MaxHeight*16 + MinSpace * 256 + MaxSpace * 4096>In decimal this value is misterious: 4 + 7 * 16 + 1*256 + 2 * 4096 = 8564>Anyway if you type in in hexadecimal format is more easy understand the position of each sub-field: 8564 decimal = $2174  in hexadecimal.>I.e. in hexadecimal the digits are (using literal A, B, C, and D as references):   >>$DCBA  >>where:>'A' is click of minimum height required>'B' is click of minimum height acceptable>'C' is number of click of min space over the support>'D' is number of click of max space over the support>>About hexadecimal notions remember the numbers, using a single digit, have following sequence: >0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A (10 decimal), B (11 decimal), C (12 decimal), D (13 decimal), E (14 decimal) and F (15 decimal) >In this way you can set number of click between 0 and 15 click for each sub-field of Distance for env.

ENV_IN_LEFT_SIDE_SECTOR:52  ;This condition checks only the position of lara respect current sector where she is.>If lara is near to left border of current sector the condition is true.>Since we are speaking of "left side" this means this condition is true when lara is (virtually) touching with her left arm the (further) wall in sector at left of the sector where she is.>In DistanceForEnv you can change the comput for distance. If you set big values the condition is true also when lara is not very closed to left border of current sector, while if you set a little value the conditon will be true only when lara is very closed to left border of current sector.>Remark: probably you should use this condition togheter with other because alone is not very useful, since it doesn't check if in sector at left of current sector there is really a wall that lara could touch. So you should use this condition togheter with [ENV_NON_TRUE+ENV_NO_BLOCK_AT_LEFT] condition to verify if really lara could touch with her left arm the wall in left side.>Remark: the default value for DistanceForEnv is 128 (1024 = one sector), this is a good value to compute touching of left wall when lara is in stand up position. If you type IGNORE in distance for env will be used 128.


ENV_IN_RIGHT_SIDE_SECTOR:53  ;This condition work in similar way of ENV_IN_LEFT_SIDE_SECTOR condition but in this case it works for right side.>Read the description of ENV_IN_LEFT_SIDE_SECTOR constant to understand the logical of this condition.

ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_AT_LEFT:54  ;This condition work like ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_IN_FRONT but it analyses for an item at left of lara. You have to insert the slot of wished item in Extra field and the  distance in DistanceForEnv.

ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_AT_RIGHT:55  ;This condition work like ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_IN_FRONT but it analyses for an item at right of lara. You have to insert the slot of wished item in Extra field and the  distance in DistanceForEnv.

ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION:56  ;This condition used to detect if there is an object of given TestPosition command is in correct position with respect to Lara.>The ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION has same target of ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_.... conditions but in this case you can accurately compare for an item in any position with respect to Lara and in absolute precise mode.>The other env conditions have some problems to detect the exact distance when the pivot of Lara and the item are too different.>To use the ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION you have to type in script a "TestPosition=" script command with all data necessary for the detection, and then you'll type in DistanceForEnv field of Animation= or MultEnvCondition= commands the IdTestPosition (first argument of TestPosition).>>Remark:>The ENV_ITEM_TEST_POSITION condition (like other ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_... conditions) has the limit to check only for items in same room where lara is. >If you want detect an item in a room different than Lara room, the only way is to set in TestPosition command the flag TPOS_TEST_ITEM_INDEX in this way you can set in Slot field (of TestPosition) an index of specific item instead a generic slot type.>>See description of TestPosition script command in the list "SCRIPT NEW commands" of Reference panel of NG_Center program, to have more informations.

ENV_HOLD_EXTRA_ITEM_IN_HANDS:57  ;The condition is true when lara holds in her hands the HOLD_... item typed in Extra field.>See descriptions of HOLD_ constants in MNEMONIC LIST of Reference panel.

ENV_CONDITION_TRIGGER_GROUP:58 ;This env condition allows to perform a TriggerGroup where you stored some exported condition triggers. In DistanceForEnv you type the IdTriggerGroup to check, if the final condition of TriggerGroup is true it will be true also the Env condition for your Animation command.

ENV_ROOM_IS:59  ;Used in Animation= command.>This condition check if current room  (where lara is) is the same of number typed in DistanceForEnv field.>Using this condition you can create a custom animation that it will work only in some room of the level.>If you need to check for more than one room, you should insert the ENV_ROOM condition list in a MultEnvCondition command.>>Remark:>In DistanceForEnv you can type the room number you wish check, but you can also write some special constants to verify the type of room, indifferently by its number.>You can type one of ROOM_... constant to test if lara is in that moment in that wished room type.>See description of ROOM_... constants for more infos.

ENV_PLAYER_IS_SLEEPING:60 ;Used in Animation= command.>This is a very original condition. Pratically it verifies from how much time are missing keyboard commands.>You have to type in DistanceForEnv the number of tickframes (one second= 30 tickframes) required to enable this condition.>For example if you want have true this condition when the player doesn't perform game commands from 3 seconds, you have to type in DistanceForEnv field the value 90 (because 3 * 30 = 90) >This condition could be used to start nice animation in stand-by mode, i.e. when the player is not playing activly (no keyboard signals) you can show an animation where lara scratches one's head, or she turns her face to look player saying: "Are you sleeping?" >If you mean use this nice animation in standby you should remember to set in this animation a state id different by standard state-ids, for example you can use the state id STATE_CONTROLLED, to avoid that some new game command cause a bad change between current (custom animation) and new standard animation.>When you use the state id neutral no new animation will be performed until lara comes back to some standard state id. >So you could create an animation with state id = STATE_CONTROLLED and as next animation the defaul animation of still stand-up. >You'll have to create a custom animation where lara starts from stand-up position, it performs the nice move, and then comes back to stand-up animation, with the next animation having the standard stand-up animation.



ENV_PLAYER_WOKE_UP:61 ;Used in Animation= command.>This env condition is the opposite of ENV_PLAYER_IS_SLEEPING. It happens when there is any game command.>In ENV_PLAYER_IS_SLEEPING description has been described a way to create stand-by animations in death times of the game.>There is also another method, a bit more complicated, and it's in this situation you need of ENV_PLAYER_WOKE_UP.>If you want perform a custom animation when there is no game commands (player is sleeping) you could put in continue mode lara in a new position, for example that she sit down and wait.>In this situation, since you used a non-standard state-id, no keyboard command will be accepted, so it should be you with an Animation command and condtion ENV_PLAYER_WOKE_UP, to force another custom animation having the target to move lara from sit down position to common stand-up position. In this new animation it will be set like next animation the standard still stand-up animation, so from this moment lara will be newly able to receive game commands.>In game the player could see this little show:>Lara (bored) sit down, and looks at left and right, then, when player hit some game command like for example the JUMP, lara will no jump, but she'll back to stand-up position, and if player hit newly jump (or other commands) lara  will come back to respond to these commands.

ENV_DISTANCE_NORTH_WALL:62 ;Used in Animation command.>This condition verify if at given distance (set in DistanceForEnv field) there is a wall to north of Lara.>WARNING: this condition works in absolute way looking only for cardinal point,  ignoring the current facing of lara so it should be used only with other env conditions to apply only for some specific room in hardcoded way.>This condition considers like "wall" any floor higher than current lara position.

ENV_DISTANCE_SOUTH_WALL:63 ;Used in Animation command.>Check if at given distance in South direction there is a wall. >See ENV_DISTANCE_NORTH_WALL description for more informations.

ENV_DISTANCE_EAST_WALL:64 ;Used in Animation command.>Check if at given distance in East direction there is a wall. >See ENV_DISTANCE_NORTH_WALL description for more informations.

ENV_DISTANCE_WEST_WALL:65  ;Used in Animation command.>Check if at given distance in West direction there is a wall. >See ENV_DISTANCE_NORTH_WALL description for more informations.

ENV_LARA_IN_MICRO_STRIP:66 ;Used in Animation command>This environment condition works in similar way than ENV_POS_STRIP_1/2/3 flags, but (IMPORTANT) remember that it is a condition and not an ENV_POS flag so you cann't add the ENV_LARA_IN_MICRO_STRIP value to another ENV_ condition. Differently you should place this ENV_LARA_IN_MICRO_STRIP condition in a MultEnvCondition script command and, furhterly you could add to this condition some ENV_POS_ flag like the (always required with this condition) ENV_POS_HORTOGONAL flag.>The ENV_LARA_IN_MICRO_STRIP allows, respect to the ENV_POS_STRIP_1/2/3 flags, a best fine precision, since with the ENV_POS_STRIP_1/2/3 flags you can choose only between three "fat" strips, while with the ENV_LARA_IN_MICRO_STRIP you can choose any specific range within the sector where it should be Lara to get true this condition.>When you use the ENV_LARA_IN_MICRO_STRIP condition you have to type in DistanceForEnv field the range (min-max) in micro-strips units, where lara should be enclosed.>The value to type in DistanceForEnv is given by following formula:>>Max*256 + Min>>Where Min and max have values in the range 0 / 31>Pratically you should imaginate a sector divided by 32 strips, in the direction where lara is looking, and you can choose in what range of 32th strips it should be Lara to get true the condition.>For example if you wish have Lara very closed to outside border (pherpas to get the condition when lara is touching a wall in closed next sector) you could choose the range 0 - 2, in this way the condition it will be true wheter Lara is in 0,1 or 2 micro strip.>Remember that the first strip (value= 0) is always that closed to border where lara is looking, while the last strip (value = 31) is that closed to border at the back of Lara.

ENV_NO_BOX_IN_FRONT:67  ;Used in AnimationSlot command>This condition detect if in front of current moveable it's missing the gray boxes used in NGLE to stop the moving of enemies.>In the DistanceForEnv field you set distance to check in front of enemy.>Note:>The _NO_BOX_ conditions should be used with AnimationSlot command on some enemy. The usage with Lara is theorically possible but not very useful.

ENV_NO_BOX_AT_LEFT:68  ;Used in AnimationSlot command>Check if at left of current enemy it's missing a box sector.>See the description of ENV_NO_BOX_IN_FRONT constant, for more infos.

ENV_NO_BOX_AT_RIGHT:69  ;Used in AnimationSlot command>Check if at right of current enemy it's missing a box sector.>See the description of ENV_NO_BOX_IN_FRONT constant, for more infos.

ENV_NO_BOX_BACK:70  ;Used in AnimationSlot command>Check if back of current enemy it's missing a box sector.>See the description of ENV_NO_BOX_IN_FRONT constant, for more infos.

ENV_ENEMY_SEE_LARA:71 ;Used in AnimationSlot command>It checks if current enemy is able to see lara.>In the DistanceForEnv field you type the angle of view of the enemy.>You type the view angle in degrees, where 180 means the enemy is able to control an emicycle in front of him. If you type 360 this means that the facing (orienting of enemy) will be not used to verify the chance to see lara but only the presence of obstacles (walls, items) in the line between enemy and lara.>A reasonable value for human view angle is about 160 degrees.>Remark: the angle view works for horizontal view, about the vertical view will be used the prefixed value of 90 degrees. This means that if lara is very higher or lower than enmey he will be not able to see her.>Another prefixed limitation is about the distance. The enemy will be never able to see lara when she is far 10 sectors or over.

ENV_FRAME_RANGE:72 ;Used in Animation command.>This ENV condition works like ENV_FRAME_NUMBER but in this case you can set a valid frame range where the condition will be true.>I suggest to read also the description of ENV_FRAME_NUMBER constant, anyway I remember that these frame checks work when you set in stateid/animation array, one animation number, typed in negative form (for instance: if you wish execute your animation only when lara is performing the animation 32, you'll type "-32" in array of Animation command).>To set the range of frames to get true the ENV condition, you set two numbers of frame range, MaxRange and MinRange, using this formula:>>MaxRange * 256 + MinRange>>Then you type this value in DistanceForEnv field.>>Notes: >* Both limits are enclosed in the valid range for a true condition>* The max value for MaxRange is 254, you cann't pass over it. 

TSB_NO_CHANGE_CAMERA:0 ;Used in StandBy command.>This standby type disable any change for look camera. You should use this type only when you use your triggergroup to customize the standby mode.

TSB_MATRIX:1 ;Used in StandBy command.>The matrix effect create a camera turning around to Lara.

TSB_PORTRAIT:2 ;Used in StandBy command.>In this standby type, the camera reamins in front of lara.>In this mode you could use a short distance value to look the beauty Lara in the eyes.

TSB_PANORAMA:3   ;Used in StandBy command.>The panorma type works like a matrix type but where the distance, the vertical angle, and the speed of rotation will continue to change in random way.>With Panorama you can create big ranges for distance while with Matrix type the max difference between min and max limits are only +/- 50% of given distance.>>In Panorma type some settings on StandBy command will be interpreted in particular way:>>The further settings for FSB_FLIP_DISTANCE, FSB_FLIP_SPEED and FSB_FLIP_V_ANGLE flags will be ignored, since Panorama type flip always the distance and vertical angle.>The value in "Distance" field will be used like Max Distance, while the min distance will be always 400 (very closed to lara).>>The value in "VAngle" field will be used like Max Vertical Angle allowed. Remember that negative numbers in VAngle mean "the camera is upper and look the lara that she is under it". >When you set a big max distance you should avoid to allow big positive values for vangle because the risk is that the camera tried to go underground. The only exception is when lara is on the top of a pyramid, where around to her the ground is lower than her position.


FSB_DISABLE_ON_CRAMPED_SPACE:$0001  ;Used in StandBy command.>This flag is strongly suggested when you use stand-by in native mode, i.e. with automatic activation after a time of inactivity.>Since you cann't know where Lara will be when the stand-by starts, it could happen that lara, in that moment, is in a cramped space. In this situation the rotation of camera could be very difficultous. To avoid this problem you can set the FSB_DISABLE_ON_CRAMPED_SPACE flag and in this way the stand-by will NOT begin when lara has around to her some too closed wall.>Remark: this method works fine only when the distance you set is less than 2048, while with higher values some very far wall could be not correctly computed and it could create problems.

FSB_DISABLE_ON_COMBAT:$0002   ;Used in StandBy command.>When you add this flag the stand-by will not be enabled while lara is in combat mode, i.e. when she extracted the weapons.>A reason to use this flag is to give to player a chance to disable the stand-by when he doesn't like it. In this way, in fact, just keep lara the the weapons in the hands to disable the stand-by.

FSB_EXIT_ON_ATTACK:$0004  ;Used in StandBy command.>This settings will quit stand-by mode when lara will be hurt by some enemies or traps.

FSB_FLIP_DISTANCE:$0008  ;Used in StandBy command.>This flag incluences matrix and portrait modes, changes in sweet way the distance.>The distance will be increased and decreased with a floating range from (Distance - 50%) to (Distance + 50%)

FSB_FLIP_V_ANGLE:$0010  ;Used in StandBy command.>This flag changes slowly the vertical angle moving it from a minimum of (VAngle - 50%) to a max of (VAngle + 50%)

FSB_FLIP_H_ORIENT:$0020 ;Used in StandBy command.>This flag do sliding the horizontal orienting of camera in a range from -45 degrees to +45 degrees.>Remark: this setting could be used only with portrait mode, since it should have no sense using it with a matrix effect, since the matrix changes continuosly the horizontal orienting byself.

FSB_FLIP_SPEED:$0040  ;Used in StandBy command.>This setting changes the rotation speed in random way. >The range will be beteen (RotateSpeed - 50%) to (RotateSpeed + 50%)>It's better usign this setting only with matrix effect.

FSB_FREEZE_ENEMIES:$0080  ;Used in StandBy command.>To avoid that lara was attacked during the stand-by mode you can use the FSB_FREEZE_ENEMIES flag to stop the activity of all enemies.>The baddy will become frozen until the standby is on.

FSB_FREEZE_LARA:$0100  ;Used in StandBy command.>With this setting the game input will be stopped during the stand-by mode.>Since in this way the player will have no chance to move lara and therefore to exit from stand-by mode, this setting should be used only with a stand-by started with the flipeffect trigger "Perform <&>StandBy mode for (E)seconds"

FSB_OVERLAP_AUDIO:$0200 ;Used in StandBy command.>When you set a valid value in AudioTrack field, you have to decide if the standby audio will replace (temporary) the current audio track, or if the new audio will be overlapped to old audio without stopping it.>When you want that the standby audio was overlapped to old audio track you add the FSB_OVERLAP_AUDIO flag, differently, if you wish the old audio track was stopped before playing the new standby audio track, just you omit the FSB_OVERLAP_AUDIO flag.>Remark: reasonably, you should use the FSB_OVERLAP_AUDIO flag only when the audio track in the level is only a list of environment sounds, like wind, sea song ect, while if the level audio is a music, it's better stop it before playing the standby audio since two musics in same moment could be chaotic.

FSB_IMMEDIATE:$0400 ;Used in StandBy command.>Usually the camera will start from current standard position and it will move slowly to reach the position required from the settings of StandBy command.>If you wish the camera starts immediatly in new required position you can use the FSB_IMMEDIATE flag,and the camera will be moved immediatly in the new position.


ROOM_WATER:-1  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is a water room. Please note that lara is a water room when she is floating on the water, or when she is swimming underwater, but she is NOT in water when she is simply walking in low water.

ROOM_QUICKSAND:-2  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in quick sand room.

ROOM_DAMAGE:-3  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in a Damage room. 

ROOM_COLD:-4  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in a cold room.

ROOM_RAIN:-5  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in a rain room.

ROOM_SNOW:-6  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in a snow room

ROOM_OUTSIDE:-7  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is outside (ponytail flys in the wind)

ROOM_REFLEX:-8  ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in a room with water light reflex (the [R] button in 2d plane).>Usually the reflex rooms are those over the water room.

ROOM_MIST:-9 ;Used in according with ENV_ROOM condition in Animation or MultEnvCondition commands.>Lara is in a room marked as mist room (the [M] button in 2d plane)

ENV_POS_STRIP_1:$8000  ;Lara is in first (more forward) strip of three ideal strips of current sector, respect where she is looking.>You can use this flag if you want that lara is near to switch or door or other items attached to wall with lara immediatly in front of them.>Remark: you can always add to current ENV condition one or more ENV_POS_ flags to specify the position of lara respect current sector

ENV_POS_STRIP_2:$4000 ;Like above, but in this case Lara is the middle strip of three stripes of current sector. See description of ENV_POS_STRIP_1 for more infos.

ENV_POS_STRIP_3:$2000 ;Like above, but now she is in third strip. See description of ENV_POS_STRIP_1 for more infos.

ENV_POS_IN_THE_MIDDLE:$1000 ;Lara is (almost) exaclty at center of current sector. This is the position for lara when she is able to jump over a rope, for example.

ENV_POS_HORTOGONAL:$0800 ;For hortogonal we mean :non diagonal. >For many animation it's necessary lara is facing exaclty a wall otherwise she will be not able to climb, hang ect.>If you add this ENV_POS flag the condition will be false if lara is too diagonal respect to wall lines.

ENV_POS_CENTRAL:$0400 ;Please don't confuse this flag with previous >ENV_POS_IN_THE_MIDDLE.>The ENV_POS_CENTRAL works fine togheter with some >ENV_POS_STRIP.. field, to set a central position in specific strip you chose.>While the ENV_POS_IN_THE_MIDDLE cann't used with ENV_POS_STRIP because that flag already set exactly the position in sector (at center).

ENV_POS_RIGHT_CORNER:$0200 ;The corner is that of current sector where lara is. This condition is true when lara is in right corner of current sector using as reference the direction where she is looking. 

ENV_POS_LEFT_CORNER:$0100 ;Works like ENV_POS_RIGHT_CORNER but for left side. See descrition of ENV_POS_RIGHT_CORNER for more infos.

ENV_NON_TRUE:$80 ;Invert the current ENV condition. You have to add this value to some ENV condition when you want have that when the condition is true it will be false, and viceversa.>For example looking belove ENV conditions you'll find the ENV_NO_BLOCK_IN_FRONT condition.>If you use this alone it means "perform my special animation only if lara has NO block in front of her face".>But if you want perform an animation requiring a block in front of lara, you can use that same conditon (ENV_NO_BLOCK_IN_FRONT) linked with + ENV_NON_TRUE, to inverse the condition.>In this combination (ENV_NON_TRUE + ENV_NO_BLOCK_IN_FRONT) we have an (ugly) double negation that it means: "when lara HAS a block in front.. . perform my special animation".>You can add ENV_NON_TRUE flag to any ENV condition, anyway remember that the ENV_NON_TRUE flag has NO effect on ENV_POS ... flags, this means the ENV_POS flags will be valued always in direct way, indifferntly if you set or less an ENV_NON_TRUE flag.

DENV_FLAG_FACE2FACE:$8000  ;Work togheter with ENV_ITEM_EXTRA... conditions, but you have to add this flag to DistanceForEnv field and not to field EnvCondition. You use it to require a specific couple of orienting (facing) for Lara and object to check.>For example if you want start your animation only when lara is face to face with SKELETON (slot id = 35) and distance is about half sector (512) you have to type:>In field ENV Condtion:  ENV_ITEM_EXTRA_IN_FRONT >In field Distance for env: 512 +DENV_FLAG_FACE2FACE>In field Extra : 35>>>Remark: the flags DENV_... are DistanceENV flags you can add to distance value to set some other settings.>About ENV_ITEM_EXTRA conditions you can add two flags DENV_ to Distance for env, to set the position about orientation of lara respect to object.>You can choose two DENV_ flags:>>DENV_FLAG_FACE2FACE  (lara and object were looking face to face)>DENV_FLAG_FACE2BACK (lara is looking object while it gives the back to lara)>>Remark: if you don't add any DENV_FLAG to distance, this means that the facing will be ignored.

DENV_FLAG_FACE2BACK:$4000 ;Works in same way of DENV_FLAG_FACE2FACE flag but in this case the condition is true when lara is back of object. See description of DENV_FLAG_FACE2FACE flag for more informations.

MIR_WEST_WALL:0  ;Mirror on west wall of current room. This was the default (and only) setting in old tomb4 egine
MIR_FLOOR:1  ;Mirror on the floor
MIR_CEILING:2  ;Mirror on the ceiling.>Remark: If you want see lara on ceiling floor you have to use a room very little in height or a fixed camera to look both laras in same time, otherwise lara is not able to rotare her neck to see other lara over her in height position.
MIR_INVERSE_WEST:3  ;Mirror on west wall but every movement and displacement of lara or other moveables will be inverted like in Tomb raider 1 when Lara meets an unskinned alien.

MIR_EAST_WALL:4 ;Mirror on east wall
MIR_SOUTH_WALL:5  ;Mirror on south wall
MIR_NORTH_WALL:6  ;Mirror on north wall

FMIR_ALTERNATE_REFLEX:$1000 ;Used in MirrorEffect command>This flag may be added to the index of an animating when in a first attempt you remained displeased about its reflex.>The technical explanation is that there are two different ways to simulate the reflex of an item. If first method (less FMIR_ALTERNATE_REFLEX) is bad, you can add the FMIR_ALTERNATE_REFLEX, rebuild the script to see if now it's better.>Like general rule the animating with a good reflex had at least two opposite sides that are specular between them.

FMIR_ADJUST_X:$2000  ;Used in MirrorEffect command>You can add this flag to the index of an animating when the reflex of the item has a bad position. This could often happen in the floor mirror when the animating has not the pivot at the center of the mesh but in a corner or over a side.>This problem happen very often with the doors.>>When you use this flag the engine tries to analyse the collision box of the item and then to adjust the X coordinate of the reflex.>>Note: the x axis is in south/north direction in the ngle view.


FMIR_ADJUST_Z:$4000 ;Used in MirrorEffect command>You can add this flag to the index of an animating when the reflex of the item has a bad position. This could often happen in the floor mirror when the animating has not the pivot at the center of the mesh but in a corner or over a side.>This problem happen very often with the doors.>>When you use this flag the engine tries to analyse the collision box of the item and then to adjust the Z coordinate of the reflex.>>Note: the z axis is in west/east direction in the ngle view.

ADD_FLAME:1  ;Add fire to current object
ADD_SMOKE:2  ;Add smoke to current object. 
ADD_BLOOD:3  ;Add blood (vlady) to current object.

ADD_MIST:4  ;Add mist to current object. Mist are sprays of water. You see the mist in waterfall. >When you use ADD_MIST there are four additional fields in AddEffect command and the new syntax of AddEffect command becomes the following:>>Syntax: AddEffect=Id, EffectType (ADD_), FlagsEffect (FADD_), JointType (JOINT_), DispX, DispY, DispZ, DurateEmit, DuratePause, Extra1 SizeMistBall, Extra2 NumberOfMistBalls, Extra3 ColorMist, Extra4 PersistenceOfMist>>These are the descriptions of extra parameters:>>Extra1 = Size of mist ball. Default value is 12>Extra2 = Number of mist balls. Default is 1. You can set a max of 4 mist balls, they will be placer over an ideal line. The mist line will be oriented following facing of current moveable,anyway you can rotate the facing of mist line using rotate flags.>Extra3 = Color of mist. You can set a MIST_COL_ value. You find all colors in reference panel of NG_Center program>Extra4 = Persistence time of mist. Default value = 6. You should use this field only if the moveable is moving fastling and you want let a wake. Bigger values, longer wakes.

ADD_LIGHT_FLAT:5  ;Used in AddEffect command>With this value you add a light of wished color to some moveable.>For "flat light" we mean a common non-blinking, non-spot light.>It's like a light-bulb.>Anyway, you can create a ritmic blink also with flat light setting correct tick frame in DurateEmit and DuratePause field.>If you use this method the blinking will be anyway different than ADD_LIGHT_BLINK since in that case the blinking is random to simulare a fire, while the blinking you get with flat light + durate emit and durate pause will be always a perfect blink, like it happens with some electronic machines.

ADD_LIGHT_BLINK:6  ;Used in AddEffect command>With this value you add a blinking light to some moveable.>The blinking light is the same of flare light, where the intensity of the light changes a bit in random way.

ADD_LIGHT_SPOT:7  ;Used in AddEffect command>This light works like a light-spot, i.e. it generates a cone of light following a given direction like the headlight of sidecar.>For this light type it's important the facing to choose the direction of the light cone.>The default facing is that of moveable where you add this effect, anyway you can change this facing using the FADD_ flags in FlagsEffect (FADD_) field.>>Remarks: >- You could have trouble if there is in same time the jeep or boats using headerlight, because this add effect uses the same light resources to generate this light-spot.>- With this kind of light you have to type  a very high Intensity value, about 200.>- You cann't change the standard yellow-white color for spot light.

ADD_LIGHT_GLOVE:8 ;Used in AddEffect command>This light has the shape of a sphere. Differently than other lights this glove light is opaque, i.e. not transparent, like the yellow halo around the lights in a fogged night.

FADD_NONE:0     ;If you don't want use any FADD_ constant you can use FADD_NONE constant in FADD field.

FADD_NO_SOUND:$0001  ;Used in AddEffect command.>This flag disable furhter sound linked with some effects like mist or fire.

FADD_IGNORE_STATUS:$0002  ;Used in AddEffect command.>By default the add effect trigger will ignore the comand of add effect if the moveable has not yet been enabled in game or if it has already killed/removed.>Anyway in some cirucstance this compute could be wrong and with some special items the result could be to fail the adding effect operation.>If you work with some of these special items (like some pickups) you can add the > FADD_IGNORE_STATUS flag. When trng finds this flag it ignores the status of moveable and it will apply always the effect also if item appears invisible or disabled.

FADD_FIRE_STRIP:$0004  ;Used in AddEffect command.>This flag may be used togheter with ADD_FLAME type.>By default the ADD_FLAME type shows a little fire in common way, while if you use the FADD_FIRE_STRIP flag it will be created an horizontal strip of fire like if the flames were shooted from a dragon (from front) or from a air-jet (from back, using also the FADD_ROTATE_180 flag).

FADD_VORIENT_90:$0008  ;Used in AddEffect command.>This flag rotate (in temporary way) the item of 90 degrees in clockwise direction on vertical axis.>>This temporary change is usefull with some particular moveables where the position of the meshes has a different vertical orienting respect than their position in first animation.>You can discover this situation using Wad Merger and verifying the mesh when there is no animation selected respest when it has been selected the first animation.>>It's important understand that all FADD_VORIENT... flags are very different than the FADD_ROTATE... flags, since the FADD_ROTATE flags will be used to give an horizontal direction (facing) for those effects moving on some ideal line, like the mist strip or fire strip.>Differently, you cann't change the direction of effects using the FADD_VORIENT flags, but you'll use these flags only when you have to fix the bad vertical orienting  of some moveables (like the jeep for example).

FADD_VORIENT_180:$0010  ;Used in AddEffect command.>Change vertical orienting by 180 degrees of moveable in temporary way before apply the compute of DispX, DispY, DispZ.>See also the description of FADD_VORIENT_90 flag to understand the particular situation when you should use these flags.

FADD_VORIENT_270:$0020  ; Used in AddEffect command.>Change vertical orienting by 270 degrees of moveable in temporary way before apply the compute of DispX, DispY, DispZ.>See also the description of FADD_VORIENT_90 flag to understand the particular situation when you should use these flags.

FADD_CONTINUE_EMIT:$0100 ;If you use this flag, the values typed in DurateEmit and DuratePause will be ignored.>You should use this flag for effect types requiring a continue emission, like mist and flames.

FADD_DURATE_STATEID:$0200  ;If you want you can keep this effect active until moveable is in current state id.>Using this flag the time durate set in trigger window will be ignored, and the effect will be removed only when moveable will change its state Id with a value different than that used at start of effect.

FADD_SMOKE_EXHAUST:$0400 ;This flag will be used only for ADD_SMOKE type effect.>There are two different smoke emitters: the default is a common smoke will go up and disappear in fast time, while other is the exahust smoke you see also in jeep or sidecar. If you want use exhaust smoke set this flag, while you want a more traditional smoke don'use this flag.

FADD_ROTATE_270:$0800 ;It works like FADD_ROTATE_90 flag but using a rotation of 270 degree. See description of FADD_ROTATE_90 flag for more infos.

FADD_ROTATE_90:$2000  ;The fadd_rotate flags are used only in particular circustances, when you use an effect type that use the orientation (horizontal) of object to compute the direction of emitting.>In this case you can alterate the orienting of emit adding one of above flags. For example if you want the mist strip will be oriented in side instead of in front of object facing, you can use FADD_ROTATE_90 flag.
  
FADD_ROTATE_180:$4000   ;It works like FADD_ROTATE_90 flag but using a rotation of 180 degree. See description of FADD_ROTATE_90 flag for more infos.

FADD_DURATE_ANIMATION:$8000  ;This flag work in very similar way of above flag fadd_durate_stateid, but in this case the value to check for condition emit/disable is the animation number.

FADD_DURATE_SINGLE_FRAME:$1000  ;This flag force the emitting to work only for single frame. There will be a single emitting and then the effect will be disabled.>I think only blood can work with this flag.

TPOS_DOUBLE_HORIENT:$0001 ;Used in TestPosition command>If you want that the correct position to detect could be in front of object (with given H Orient) but also in the opposite side, you can set this flag.>When in TestPosition there is the TPOS_DOUBLE_HORIENT flag, the testposition condition will be true also if lara is in opposite side for what you set the ranges of testposition.>For example using an item like a gate, you can use TPOS_DOUBLE_HORIENT to permit to lara to be in correct position for both side of the gate.>>Remark: this flag works fine only if the item has its pivot in same position of visible mesh. >Unfortunately, in many circustances the pivot (origin x,y,z of object) is not at center of its mesh but in a corner of sector where it will be placed.

TPOS_FOUR_HORIENT:$0002  ;Used in TestPosition command>With this flag the correct position will be each position for each side of object.>The example could be a cube like a squared pushable object, where lara is able to interact with every side of the pushable.>Remark: To work fine, it's necessary that the object had its pivot (origin x,y,z of object) exactly in central position of object mesh.

TPOS_TEST_ITEM_INDEX:$0004  ;Used in TestPosition command>Adding this value in Flags of TestPosition you change the mean of "Slot Moveable" field.>When you use TPOS_TEST_ITEM_INDEX flag, trng engine will consider the value in "Slot Moveable" field like an index of item to check.>You find the index in NGLE program, clicking on wished item, you'll see the index in yellow frame.>The advantage to use an index is to can test a moveable also if it is extern a lara room, while in other case (checking for slot) the testposition detects only items in same room where lara is.>By other hand, the disavantage to use this flag is that, in this way, you cann't detect all object in general way but you have to specify only one item index.

TPOS_FAST_ALIGNMENT:$0008  ; Used in TestPosition command>In the reality this flag affects the (furhter) alignemnt phase when you used the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS constant in the Animation command that called this TestPosition command.>When you use an Animation command and you used also the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS, when Lara is in a good position for TestPosition command, she will be moved in perfect ideal position before performing the animation.>Well, in some circustances the old method used to move lara byself in ideal position had a problem of continuos loop when she was too closed to target position to reach.>To solve this problem you could use in TestPosition command the TPOS_FAST_ALIGNMENT flag, and in this case Lara will be moved very fastly in correct position avoiding the risk of looping.>Remark: you should use the fast alignment only when you set a very low tollerance in TestPosition command, i.e. when the condition of testpostion will be true when lara is really very closed to ideal position.

TPOS_OPPOSITE_FACING:$0010  ;Used in TestPosition command.>The alignment with some objects could fail because the main mesh has an opposite facing respect to animation 0 displacement.>You can discover this situation with Animation Editor of Wad Merger: when the position of mesh with "No Animation" is the opposite of mesh in "Animation 0" you are in this situation and the self alignment could fail.>To fix this bug you can use the TPOS_OPPOSITE_FACING flag in the TestPosition command used by your Animation command.

TPOS_ROUND_HORIENT:$0020 ;Used in TestPosition command.>This flag works ignoring the facing of the object but it checks only the facing's Lara.>To understand the situation you have to think about alignment of lara with pole-rope. In this case it's not important the facing of the pole-rope but only that lara is looking to its direction(and the distance).>>Since the round facing is very particular there are some special rules and limitations:>>* The couple (XDistanceMin / XDistanceMax) and (ZDistanceMin / ZDistanceMax) should have the same values, anyway trng engine will read only the pair (ZDistanceMin / ZDistanceMax).>>* The range (HOrientDiffMin / HOrientDiffMax) is the only orienting pair to be verified.>>* If you use this flag in a  TestPosition command with an Animation command having the FAN_ALIGN_TO_ENV_POS flag, the position of Lara will be moved in ideal position but only in immediate way (no sliding or smoothed movement).>For this reason it's better using limited ranges about max / mix distance and DiffMin / DiffMax horizontal orient, to avoid a too jerk movement in game.

TPOS_TURN_FACING_90:0040  ;Used in TestPosition command.>This flag fix a problem with some items. In some circustance an item has a wrong facing, turned by 90 degrees, and you discover this situation when, enabling self-alignment feature, you see that lara moves in wrong position.>Only way to discover if this flag fix the probelm is trying to use it and seeing the final moving of lara to be aligned.

TPOS_TURN_FACING_180:$0080 ;Used in TestPosition command.>This flag fix a problem with some items. In some circustance an item has a wrong facing, turned by 180 degrees, and you discover this situation when, enabling self-alignment feature, you see that lara moves in wrong position.>Only way to discover if this flag fix the probelm is trying to use it and seeing the final moving of lara to be aligned.>Note: this flag, differently by TPOS_TURN_FACING_90 flag, will affect ONLY the aligment phase, while it will be ignored in testposition phase.

TPOS_SELF_FIXING:$0100 ;Used in TestPosition command.>The self fixing works to recognize a problematic situation and it tries to fix it itself.>Technically, the problematic situation is when the difference between HOrient of Lara and that of Item is about $8000.>The problem is that, in short values (like tomb4 manages the horient values) the $7fff value is a great positive number (+32767), while the $8000 value is a very little (and negative) number (-32768).>This situation creates the paradox that, the "hOrientDifMin" value, you set in script command, it will be higher than "hOrientDifMax". This is bad, and tomb4 procedure return false.>The self-fixing recognize itself, this situation and tries to fix it.

SET_BLIND_SAVEGAMES:$0002 ;If you want forbid players of your game to use savegame editor to change savegames, just you add this flag in Settings command.>Any attempt of players to modify savegames will cause immediate crash at reload.

SET_PERFORM_FROM_CD:$0004  ;With this constant your game will be able to be performed from CD / DVD and generally from only-read storage support.>Pratically the reason to use this setting is when you want give your game to some friend, stored on cd and playable directly from CD with no need of installation of level editor (TRLE) folder on local disk.>When this setting is present the trng engine will save and load savegame not from current TRLE folder where is has been store, but in/from new folder in local drive C: with same name of first level description different by title.>For example if you use this option with a level described in script.txt like "City Of The Dead", trng will create a folder named:>>C:\City_Of_The_Dead>>and it will save and load savegames in/from this folder.>>Remark:>If you want create an autostart CD in this way, you have to perform following steps:>>1) Add in script.txt file in [Options] section the command:>>Settings = SET_PERFORM_FROM_CD >>(You can also add other SET_ flag to above line, of course)>>2) Build script.txt>>3) When you have in TRLE folder all level files (.dat , .tr4) necessary to play your game, you can save whole TRLE folder, including also the name of TRLE folder, in CD image to burn on cd support.>>4) Before burning image you should add to image also following files, you find in Extra_NG_File.zip:>>START.exe>autorun.inf>>>5) Now you can burn the CD and, at end, you should get following list browsing the new created CD:>>START.exe>autorun.info>TRLE   (Folder)>>Remark: the start.exe and autorun.inf files should be in root of CD, i.e. outside of TRLE folder>>6) Now just inserting this cd in some CD reader and the game will be started and played byself, without need of installation on local disk (of target computer) of TRLE or other files or programs.

SET_CRYPT_SCRIPT:$0008 ;Setting this flag the script.dat file will be crypted to forbid decompilation with some utilities.>If you set some security issues, like SET_DISABLE_CHEATS, it's advisable set also crypting of script.dat, otherwise some guy could simply decompile the script.dat and recompile it removing the SET_DISABLE_CHEATS flag.

SET_FORCE_SOFT_FULL_SCREEN:$0010 ;Used in Settings= command.>Note: from 1.2.2.7 version the previous SET_SOFT_FULL_SCREEN has been removed, anyway current SET_FORCE_SOFT_FULL_SCREEN constant performs the same job.>So, the real news, it's another: now the player is able to set or remove the soft full screen setting it byself, because this setting has been included in tomb raider setup window.>For this reason I changed the name of set_soft_full_screen to remember to you that now it's different that in the past.>Now you can omit any soft full screen setting, and the player will be able to enable or less it as he wish.>For this reason, it should be better do not use this forcing of soft full screen, because if you use it in the script, the player will be not able to disable it from setup window. It's more logical that it was the player to choose if to use or less this option, since he knows his computer, and how it works, better than you.>>There are complicated questions about this setting.>When the game  (tomb4) works in full screen it's difficultous for trng starts a movie (FMV) because this screen mode, known as "full screen", is really an Exclusive mode, i.e. the game catches the screen and don't wish release it to other directx task (like the FMV viewer).>From version 1.2.0.9 I tried a way to stole to tomb4 the screen to play the FMV but this fight is complicated and so on some computers you could see some blinking at start and at end of FMV viewing.>If you think that these blinking are too boring you can use the  SET_FORCE_SOFT_FULL_SCREEN setting in the Settings= command.>With this setting the Exclusive Full Screen Video Mode will be converted at fly in a Software (cooperative) Full Screen mode.>Pratically the game will be showed in full screen, too, but the directx mode will be not exclusive and therefore the FMV will be showed with no need to fight. So no blinking or slow time at start or end the FMV.>>Remark: This setting will have no effect if the user set tomb4 to work in windowed mode. This settings works only when tomb raider has been set to work in full screen mode.

SET_ACCEPT_EXTRA_TAILINFOS:$0020 ;Used in Settings= command.>This setting forces trng engine to accept upto 32767 tail infos in the tr4 files.>Also using this setting the limit for ngle remains the old limit of 1024 tail infos, therefore the only reason to use this setting is when you use the program meta2tr to replace the room meshes directly in tr4 file.>Since meta2tr increases the number of tail infos you can use this setting to support the new extra tail infos.>Differently when you use the tr4 creadted by ng_tom2pc without changing, this setting is futile and probably also dangerous since it could create some trouble with animated range textures.

SET_FORCE_NO_WAITING_REFRESH:$0040  ;Used in Settings= command.>This setting, togheter with SET_FORCE_SOFT_FULL_SCREEN setting, borns to change the setting of tomb raider game to solve some problem with FMV playing or about flickering with images.>The speech about the opportunity to use this setting is the same done in the SET_FORCE_SOFT_FULL_SCREEN description: since the player is able to set or less this option byself, using the tomb raider setup window, it's better do not use this setting in the script to let the player free to enable or less it in according with the performance of >>Technically this setting disables the waiting setting in the flip directx method.>Some experiment demostrates that this disabling is able to remove flickering of images from exclusive full screen resolution.


RAIN_DISABLED:0  ;It's the same that don't insert any Rain= command in script

SNOW_DISABLED:0   ;This settings is the same to omit to insert Snow= command. The futher rooms labeled as "Snow" room in ngle will be ignored, i.e. no snow effect will be showed.

SNOW_SINGLE_ROOM:1  ;Only the room with "Snow" label in ngle and with [O] (outside) status will have the snow in game.>Each room will have own snow intensity read from field Water Intensity at right of multistate button Water/Rain/Snow ...

SNOW_ALL_OUTSIDE:2  ;The snow will be showed in all outside rooms, ignoring multistate button. This means that also a room without "snow" button will have the snow if it is different than Water room and it has the [O] outside status.>>Remarks:>(1) If you use SNOW_ALL_OUTSIDE setting, and you want set the intensity for snow in all level, you can set a single room with "Snow" attribute in ngle and set in that room in water intensity field the value for snow intensity. That value will be used for whole level.>>(2) If you don't mean to use snow rooms in current level it's better use command "Snow=SNOW_DISABLED" to inform trng engine to avoid a lot of computes to locate further snow rooms.

SEQ_LOOP:$0001  ;The sequence will be perfomed in endless way. If you use this flag you'll have to use specific flipeffet to stop the sequence, otherwise it will be performed continuously.

SEQ_LOOP_INVERSE:$0002  ;This flag works only if you set also SEQ_LOOP flag.>While the single SEQ_LOOP flag set an infinite loop with this sequence (supposing 4 textures from 0 to 3):>>0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 ....>>When you set also the SEQ_LOOP_INVERSE flag, the sequence will be:>>0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 ..

CUST_DISABLE_SCREAMING_HEAD:1   ;The CUST_DISABLE_SCREAMING_HEAD disable the change of normal Lara head (from Lara Skin slot) with screaming head when she is shooting (from Lara Scream slot).>>Syntax: Customize=CUST_DISABLE_SCREAMING_HEAD>>The reason to disable the change of heads could be when you perform a standard swap mesh for lara but the screaming head remain untouched. In this circustance when player will shoot the new lara Head will be replaced with the old screaming head of Lara ruining the new mesh coerence. >Differently if you set this CUST value, Lara will have always a single head avoiding above problem after a swap mesh operation.>Remark: another way to solve the problem is to use an advanced Swap mesh, replacing also the mesh in Lara Scream slot, using a swap mesh where is present also "Shooting Head".

CUST_SET_SECRET_NUMBER:2  ;Arguments: NumberOfSecrets>With this cutomize you can substitute the text in Statics screen of game where is the row: Secrets Found ".. / 70">The value you type (NumberOfSecrets) will substitute the default "70" for max amount of secrets.>>You can use this customize in two way:>* If you want show a different max amount of secrets, levels for leves, i.e. in each level a different amout of secrets for that level, you have to place a row:>>Syntax:Customize=CUST_SET_SECRET_NUMBER, NumberOfSecrets>>In each level of your script dat (excluding Title level)>In this way you can set different values to specify the amount of secretd for each level.>>While other chance is:>>* Modify the global amout of secrets it will be the same for all levels.>In this case you have to use a single Customize line and place it in level section of Title level.>Typing a single CUST_SET_SECRET_NUMBER in title level it will affect this setting for all levels.

change these values only when you are trying to change this animation to extract weapons.>For little weapons (pistols, uzi and sixshooter) you have to set the same frame for both field, and the game engine will use that frame -1 to place the weapon in holster, while that frame +1 to place the weapon in Lara's hands.>The reason of this method is because the game engine will use always the same animation to extract weapon or to place them in holsters, only the frame will change a bit +1 or -1 in according with extract or place-in animation.>>About the big weapons like shotgun, grenade-gun and crossbow you have two different frames to extract or place-in holders operation.>>>Following table shows the default values:>>          PlaceWeaponInHand

hypothesis.>>Pistols = 650>Revolver= 650>UZI = 650>Shotgun = 500>GrenadeGun = 500>CrossBow = 500>>Unknown field>------------->I've not any idea about what is the target of this field.>Anyway you should discover this target performing some attempts with different values.>In my experiments I discovered only that this value is not used when lara extracts the weapon and neither when she is shooting.>Pherpas it works about aiming.>>For all weapons the default value is 1820>>FrameCounter field>------------------>Another misterious field.>This value I presume is a number of frame and surely it will be decremented by 1 for each game cycle.>I suppose it could be a sort of "framerate" field to multiplicate the durate of animation to slow down extract weapon animation.>This field is used only for Pistol, UZI and revolver.>>Default values:>>Pistols = 4>Revolver = 7>UZI = 4>>FrameMinRange and FrameMaxRange fields>-------------------------------------->I've not yet discovered the precise usage of these two fields.>I have discovered only they are frame values and these two values were used like the min and max values of a range.>These two fields will be used only for Pistols, revolver and UZIs>If you change the frame to extract weapon (see above fields FrameToTakeWeapon and  FrameToLetWeapon fields) you should remember that this number of change weapon has to be within this misterious range of FrameMinRange and FrameMaxRange fields, otherwise the animation will not change weapon in correct way.>>Default values:>>Pistols = min: 5   max: 24>Revolver= min: 8   max: 29>UZIs =    min: 5   max: 24>>OrigX, OrigY, OrigZ, OrigOrient field>------------------------------------->These fields work only for weapon launching real (visible) ammo, like GrenadeGun and CrossBow.>If you change animation of shape of weapon meshes you could require to change also the origin of bullet at start of its movement.>The OrigX, OrigY and Origz are algebrical values (+ or - values) and they will added to default current position for bullet.>To understand how set these three values you could read the description of AddEffect script command where there are the DispX, DispY, and DispZ field that works in same way.>About the OrigOrient field, it set the degree about direction of bullet.>If you set 0 the direction will be not changed respect than default value, while if you set some positive or negative value the (horizontal) direction will be changed of wished degrees.>The way to set degree is particular.>>90 degrees to east will be 16384 ($4000)>90 degrees to west will be -16384 ($C000)>>You can set also intermediate values, of course, anyway you can use above example to understand how compute other values.

In this way you'll be able to use young lara with correct hair type (using CUST_HAIR_TYPE)and keeping, in same time, also the weapons like for adult lara, because the engine will consider lara as adult lara since you have not type YoungLara=ENABLED.>Pratically, this customize value (CUST_HAIR_TYPE) is useful to divide the setting about hair from that about weapons. If you use old command YoungLara you cann't distinguish setting about hair from setting for weapons, or you choose "two plaits" of your lara but then you renounce also the weapons, otherwise, you choose adult lara and you have the weapons but you'll have always the single ponytail look.>Differently, using CUST_HAIR_TYPE  you can use YoungLara only to set or less the weapons, while you'll use Customize=CUST_HAIR_TYPE  to set the hair style.

The combat has some settings a bit different respect than "chase" camera.>>Flags (FCAM_...) field>---------------------->You can type in this field one or more FCAM_ flags to change some behavior of Camera.>See the list of FCAM_ values in  MNEMONIC CONSTANTS list of Reference panel of NG_Center program.>Remark: you can type IGNORE in this field if you don't wish set any flag.>>>DistanceChaseCam field>---------------------->This value works for "chase" camera or "follow me" we could say. >This field is the distance (behind lara) where is the camera.>The default value is  1536 ($600), where 1024 ($400) is one game sector.>If you reduce this value the camera will be closest to lara and all level (and lara) will seem more near. If you increase this value the distance from lara will be larger and lara will appear littler.>>Remark: if you type a negative value in this field, the camera will be in front of lara instead of at her back.>It's interesting note as the HOrientChaseCam field with $8000 value and the DistanceChaseCam with a negative value get the same target but only using only one of them in same time. In fact, if you set $8000 as HOrient see description below) and also a negative Distance you'll get newly the usual camera following lara from back.>>You can type IGNORE in this field if you don't wish change this value>>>VOrientChaseCam field>-------------------->This field works for "chase" camera, and it is the vertical difference of orientation (facing) of camera respect to lara.>To understand what it "vertical orientation" try to look the tutorial for animation and testposition commands. In that help file there is an image showing own the Vertical Orientation.>The default value is -1820 and, since it is a difference (like degrees difference respect to a line parallel to floor) this means the cam is a bit higher than lara. >If we choose +1820 the camera should be a bit lower than lara.>If we type -16384 the camera should exactly overt the top of lara (90 degrees respect to line parallel to floor passing for lara)>If we type +16384 the camera should below lara with 90 degrees angle, but this setting could work only when lara is monkey or she is falling down.>If we type 0 (zero) the camera will be exactly with same Y origin of lara, because the camera and lara should be on same line parallel to floor.>>Remark: some settings in this field could be ignored when the value is so much big ( in absolute value) to cause to show lara upside down. For example the value -32767 should get a camera looking lara in the face but with lara appears upside down. In the reality, using this value (-32767) you'll get the same result typing -16384 and this happens because the game engine uses a cut-off function to forbid to show lara upside down. For above reason the valid range for this field is from -16384 to +16384>>You can type IGNORE in this field if you don't want change it.>>HOrientChaseCam field>--------------------->This field is a bit complicated to explain. >It works like HOrientDifference of TestPosition command.>The orientantion is also named "facing" i.e. where an object is looking.>This value changes the facing of Source camera.

CUST_DISABLE_MISSING_SOUNDS:29  ;used in Customize command.>>Syntax: Customize=CUST_DISABLE_MISSING_SOUNDS>>This setting, disable in old tomb4 code the playing of obsolete sound effects like the sound for bubbles (37 - LARA_BUBBLES) and that for pickup item (62 - LARA_PICKUP).>You should use this setting when you use Boats or other new object that uses some of above old sounds. In fact, in old example about boats on Trng website, there was a boring bad sound when lara swims underwater, and also when she picked up some item. The reason was the new boat object required to use some new sounds but, since there was way to add new sound slot, I tried to use unused sound effect of old tomb4. Unfortunately, also these (missing) sounds had a code in tomb4 to play them, so when I added the sounds for boats, the tomb4 engine played some of these sounds also as bubbles or pickup.>Setting CUST_DISABLE_MISSING_SOUNDS, the old codes for bubbles and pickup will no more play sound s62 and 37, but new objects like boats or other, will be able to play the new sounds assigned for above sound slots.

This behavior is different than that you see when Lara touches a wall, where she stop her immediatly.>Using CUST_SET_STILL_COLLISION customize, you can give to item collision same behavior you see in wall collision.>>CollisionFlags (COLL_....) field>-------------------------------->In this field you can type, one, two or more COLL_ flags to enable the still collision with different types of items.>>See the descriptions of COLL_.. constants in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section of Reference panel.>>LowerHeight field>----------------->In this field you can type the lower (acceptable) hight that an item may have to enable the still collision.>Theorically you can also type 0 in this field, and in this way all selected items will enable the still collision.>>Anyway you should think about this little problem: when lara touches a very little (low) item with her feet, like an one-click height item, it should be weird see her stopped immediatly like wheter that little item was an unpassable obstacle.>In this situation pheraps it's better let the old "sliding" collision, used with items.>The reason of above speech, is that, when a little (low) obstacle is a moved up floor (like a little wall) lara could be able to walk over it, while with statics and moveables this is not possible, therefore we have our problem about the realism to solve.>>If you type IGNORE in this field, it will be used the (reasonable) value of 300 units as lower acceptable height.>>Remark: Remember the units used in this field have these references: one click = 256 units, one sector = 1024 units.>>MoveableArray field>------------------->From this field you can type one or more moveable slot using the still collision.>You can also let empty this field, of course.>>Remember that you can select different moveable class using some COLL_ flag, so my suggeston is to use these COLL_ flags and only when you find some moveable not enclosed in COLL_ flags you should use the MoveableArray.>>For example if you want having still collision also with the moveable POLEROPE and with the ROLLINGBALL, you type a customize command like this:>>Customize=CUST_SET_STILL_COLLISION, COLL_STATICS+COLL_DOORS, IGNORE, POLEROPE, ROLLINGBALL>>In this way, other to have still collision with statics and doors, you'll have still collision also with pole rope and rollingball.>>Another interesting usage of MoveableArray  array, is when you want exclude some moveable from still collision.>This trick will have a sense only when you had typed some COLL_ moveable types, of course.>>For example, we suppose you enabled the still collision for all doors (COLL_DOORS) but you discovered that there is some problem with a door you used for a "race vs time". In this situation when lara touches the door while it is closing, lara froze immediatly.>Since you are a good boy, you want let to the player the chance to "slide" over the closing door and for this reason, you disable the still collision only for that type of door, preserving the other doors.>>In this case you have to type the number of slot to exclude as a negative number.>>For example if you want exclude the DOOR_TYPE4 with slot number 325, you can type this script command:>>Customize=CUST_SET_STILL_COLLISION, COLL_STATICS+COLL_DOORS, IGNORE, -325>>Remark: it's better don't use the syntax "-DOOR_TYPE4" because the mixing of mnemonic constant and aritmetic sign "-" minus, could confuse NG_Center in some circustances.

In some (few) experiment of mine, the boats move in direction of them left side but this could change using other setting for rolling effect.>>Remark: while for rubber boat and motor boat there is a native procedure for drift, for the kayak (and further fake boats in animating slots) the drift procedure has been created in trng engine.>This drift simulation, to avoid risks to move kayak in positions not reachable from lara to go in newly in the kayak, tries to avoid problems keeping the kayak to at least one sector from walls (or beatch) and it avoids also to move in low depth water, one click or less.>Knowning above features you could creare an invisible barrier to stop drift from start position simply creating a low water around the kayak, or walls in at least three sides around the kayak and in this way the drift will be temporary disabled.

DRT_ADD_EFFECT:$0002 ;Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command>I you wish, you can add some effect for each dart>When you use this flag you have to type in IdAddEffect field the ID of AddEffect script command where you set the effect to add to the dart.>>Remarks: >- Warning, this feature could be very cpu intensive. If you have many dart emitters in your level my suggestion is to disable the emitter already visited by Lara, using a Untrigger to free the resource for those no more used dart-emitters.>Another suggestion is to set a big Emitting timer (to slow down the emitting) and/or an high Speed value to avoid having too much darts enabled in same time.>>- In the AddEffect command, pointed by IdAddEffect field, some fields will be ignored: DurateEmit and DuratePause, while other fields should have always same value: the JointType should be always set to JOINT_SINGLE_MESH value.>Pratically the engine will be interested only by the type of effect while for the  emitting time it   will be constant for the life-time of the dart.

DRT_PERFOM_TRIGGERGROUP:$0004  ;Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command>If you add this flag you can transform the dart emitter in a sort of sensor line, where, when a dart touches lara, it will be perfomed some trigger.>Pratically it could be like an electronic alarm. In this case you have to type in IdTriggerGroup field the ID of trigger group to perform.>>Remarks:>>- You can reduce the speed and change the color (for example with red or green) to give to the dart emitting the look of a laser ray. >>- If you use the dart emitter like a sensory line is advisable disable the poison with the DRT_NO_POISON flag, since it has no sense the poisoning performed by a laser ray and also the smoke and crash sound wiht the DRT_NO_SMOKE flag.>>- When some dart touches Lara and the triggergroup will be performed the index of the dart emitter will be stored in the internal variable [Found item index]. In this way you could insert in the trigger group also an action trigger using the TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag, to disable that dart emitter with this action trigger:>>; Exporting: TRIGGER(44:0) for ACTION(0)>; <#> : LARA                       ID:0      in sector:(8,7) of Room3>; <&> : Trigger. (Moveable) Untrigger <#>Object with (E)Timer value>; (E) : Timer= +00>; Values to add in script command: $5000, 0, $2C>>and the values will be added in triggergroup command in this way:>>TriggerGroup=  ....  ,$5000 + TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX, 0, $2C>>to use the found index instead of that set in original trigger (it was lara)>>- The best way to have a very realistic laser sensory line avoiding in same time to slow down the engine is to disable the showing of darts with the DRT_HIDE_DART flag to free cpu time. >Disable smoke and crash sounds with the DRT_NO_SMOKE. >Disable also the poisoning with DRT_NO_POISON flag.>Now we should decrease furhter the emittingtimer of a bit to have most invisible dart showed. This is necessary to avoid that Lara was able to pass our sensory line without touching the darts.>Now the only problem is that the sensory line is fully invisible. We can solve this problem using a static object with no collision builded like the tight-rope bar, and adding to it the same texture used for waterfall to give to it a pulse/flushing effect.>Then in NGLE just place the dart emitting in some direction and hight and then place also the static sensory bar in same position where the darts should be emitted to have many pulsing semi-transparent laser sensory in our very hi-tech level. Each of this sensory line could be used like trigger to activate other stuff like enemys, doors, flipmaps ect.

DRT_NO_SMOKE:$0008 ;Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command>This flag remove the smoke when dart hit the wall and also the sound of the crash.>You should use this flag when you want give to dart the look of ray laser.

DRT_HIDE_DART:$0010  ;Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command>This flag get fully invisible the dart. The only case where you could use this setting is when you have added some effect to darts with the DRT_ADD_EFFECT flag and you wish that only the effect (like mist or fire) was visible.>This setting helps also to free the cpu of a lot of 3d graphic operations.

DRT_FIX_POISON_BUG:$0020 ;Used in Customize=CUST_DARTS command>In default Tomb4 there was a bug about poisoning with darts.>While the poison of scorpion and harpies worked correctly with the screen deformation and lara losing HP, the poison of dart remained only an instant and it was immediatly removed.>If you want fix this bug to get a real poisoning of lara just you add the DRT_FIX_POISON_BUG flag.


FR_PLAY_SFX:$0001 ;Used in Customize=CUST_RAIN command.>You can enable the playing of a sound effect when the drops hit the floor.>You should type the number of sound effect to play in Extra field of Customize=CUST_RAIN command.>Remarks:>- By default there is no sound for rain.>- It's advisable using a sound sample set to work in loop mode.


FR_ADD_DRIPS_TO_LARA:$0002 ;Used in Customize=CUST_RAIN command.>You can enable the drips on lara after she has been under the rain using this flag.>By default there is no drips when lara is under the rain but only after lara has been in a pool.

FR_CORRECT_SPRINKLERS:$0004 ;Used in Customize=CUST_RAIN command.>In default code the elaboration of sprinklers (when the rain drop touches the ground) was a bit leak. If the room had an irregular floor (not flat at same height) many sprinlers were not visible because they were generated under ground.>If you want correct this bug you can add the FR_CORRECT_SPRINKLERS flag.

HRP_NO_SWIM_UNDERWATER:$0001 ;Used in Customize=CUST_HARPOON command.>If you set this flag, lara will be not able to swim when she holds the harpoon in her hands.>This settings should be more realistic since when lara has here hands busy it's not logical she was able to swim undwerwater.

HRP_SINGLE_AMMO:$0002  ;Used in Customize=CUST_HARPOON command.>Since harpoon weapon uses the slot of crossbow,  by default the harpoon has three different ammo types (normal, poison, explosive). If you wish having the harpoon gun classic you can use this flag to have a single type of ammo in inventory for this weapon.

HRP_DOUBLE_AMMO:$0004  ;Used in Customize=CUST_HARPOON command.>Since harpoon weaponauses the slot of crossbow,  by default the harpoon has three different ammo types (usormal, poison, explosive). If you wish having only two ammo: normal and explosive, you can use this flag.

HRP_DISABLE_LASER_SIGHT:$0008 ;Used in Customize=CUST_HARPOON command.>If you want forbid the usage of laser sight with the harpon gun, you can add this flag.

FMV_FADE_OUT:$01  ;Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.>If you wish there was a fade out before start the FMV you can add the FMV_FADE_OUT in FlagsFMV field of Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.>Remark: fade-out means the game will become darker until to black and only after this changing the video will be played.

FMV_SHORT_BLACK_RESTART:$02 ;Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.>With this flag when the fmv has been completed the screen will be blacks for two frame (less than 1/10 of second).>In some circustance it's useful have this black screen to avoid that player can see the game image was on screen first of fmv playback.>This situation could be a problem when you want modify the game situation immediatly after the FMV.>Using the FMV_SHORT_BLACK_RESTART in according with a global trigger GT_FMV_COMPLETED, you can perform some trigger to change game situation after the movie, avoiding that player can see the old game screen.>>Remark: in spite of GT_FMV_COMPLETED global trigger, if you omit a black restart the old screen game could be visible for 1/30 of second. Therefore everytime you wish modify the game screen after a FMV it's necessary add a BLACK RESTART flag, short or long.

FMV_LONG_BLACK_RESTART:$04  ;Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.>This flag is very alike than FMV_SHORT_BLACK_RESTART, so read also the description of that flag to have more infos.>This long version of black restart, remains with a black screen for one second after the end of FMV.>There are some reasons to use this long black restart (instead of shorter version).>Some changing in game required a bit of time to be engaged. For example a rope just enabled will have a starting animation, a change of position of lara will require a moving of follow-me camera to look lara correctly.>If the changes you perform after the FMV require some time you can use the long black screen to show to player only final and stable game position.

FMV_NO_AUDIO_RESTART:$08   ;Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.>By default, trng stops the cd track before starting the FMV, and restart the same cd in same position when the FMV has been completed.>In some cirucstance you could wish to avoid to restart the cd track at end of fmv , this could happens  for example when you mean change the cd track at end of fmv or load another level.>In above situation the cd track just restarted should be immediatly newly stopped to be changed with new track. Since this operation is a bit boring to listen you can use the FMV_NO_AUDIO_RESTART flag to let the silence at end of fmv, so you can start new different cd track with some trigger in more sweet way.

FMV_PRE_CACHE:$10  ;Used in Customize=CUST_FMV_CUTSCENE command.>This flag try to fast the start of first fmv played in current game session.>It used like a PRELOAD flag for images, but in this case the fmv will be NOT loaded in memory (because the fmvs could be too big), but simply it will be inserted in Windows cache.>Pratically it happens this situation: when a file (like a fmv file) has to be loaded from a folder where the user had not yet done any access, Windowd spends a bit of time to scan whole folder and locate the file. Differently, when a first access had been already done, windows load more fastly that file.>So, to insert the TRLE\FMVs folder in windows cache you can use this flag, and trng will perform a first access to FMVs folder while the current level (where there are fmvs) is being to load.



FCAM_DISABLE_COMBAT_CAM:$0001 ;Used in Customize=CUST_CAMERA>This flag disables fully the combat camera mode anyway it doesn't affect the automatic aiming feature. The arms of lara will point the further enemy, too, but the camera mode will remain the Chase camera or other camera mode that, in same moment, was working.
 
FCAM_INVISIBLE_LARA_ON_LOOK_CAM:$0002 ;Used in Customize=CUST_CAMERA>This flag get lara fully invisible when the player is using the look camera.>By default Lara was only semi-transparent in that situation.

PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE:$0001  ;Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.>By default the power of jump is given by OCB value set in parallel bar object in NGLE program. >If you add the PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE flag the power of jump will depend by number of full turns around the bar. For each turn the power of jump will be increased by number in OCB value.>For example, if you type 50 in OCB field, and lara perform 3 full turn before let the Action key, the power will be 50 * 3 = 150>The max power is 10 turns, other this limit the power will be not increased furtherly.>Remark: if you use also the flag PB_LARA_CAN_SLIDE, to permit to lara to move left/right hanged at bar, everytime lara moves left/right the counting of jump power will be cleared , restarting from OCB Value.>This is useful when the player need to perform a correct number of turns but he has also to move lara in a different position of bar. In this way it's always possibile set the correct number of turns: when the player passed over the correct number of turn, just he moves left/right lara to reset and restart the counting.

PB_LARA_CAN_SLIDE:$0002  ;Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.>By default lara is not able to move herself when she hanged to bar. She can only to turn.>Differently, adding the PB_LARA_CAN_SLIDE value in CUST_PARALLEL_BARS, lara will be able to slide to left or to right.>>Remarks: >>* You can place two or more closed PARALLEL_BARS items in NGLE to create a very long bar and Lara will be able to move long all this path.>>* The power of jump will be affected by last parallel bar item touched by lara before letting the bar to perform the jump. This speech is useful about the ocb value set in parallel bar item. If you create a very long bar, using different parallel_bar, you could set different OCB values in these items, and lara will jump with different powerness in according with the ocb value stored in single parallel bar used for last.

PB_MULTIPLE_ENDINGS:$0004 ;Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.>By default Lara will perform always a correct jump, indifferently by the moment when she lets go the bar.>In this way it's not possible to wrong, because the jump is always the same.>If you use the PB_MULTIPLE_ENDINGS flag the situation changes: now lara could wrong the exiting from turning: falling vertically, handlong or in stand-up position.>>Remarks:>>* This option is not perfect because the state id change should require a correct, specific, next animation to continue the source animation of turning in precise way, frame for frame, while I tried to link source animation with some default animations like that of headlong diving and fast falling (with lara screaming).>>* Theorically you could add your new custom animation and link them to animation 462 state id = 128, whereby the change state id editor of wad merger program.>If you create a new animation where lara loses the hanging in a different point of the turn, just you create a change state-id where you set the range of frames for 462 animation where you want that lara can let go the bar. Then you set as state id = 129, and the number of your new animation.>If you perform this attempt it's better don't use the PB_MULTIPLE_ENDINGS value because this flag perform a change of state id in hardcoded mode and this could interfere with your changes of state id.>Technically the code performs this computes: >- When detect that lara lets go the Action key: set as next state id = 129>- This change doesn't happen immediatly but only when the infinite animation 462 find a frame range in state id change correct.>- By default this happens only between frame 8 and 9 of anim 462, and the next animation will be the animation 463>You can add new animation starting from some of intermediate position of rotation, and then apply to specific frame range where lara has that starting position.


PB_DOUBLE_FACE:$0008  ;Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.>By default, the Chronicles parallel bar has a weird property: it works with long jumps only from a side, while from opposite side the jump is like disabled, lara simply performs a single pirouette and remains in the closed sector.>Probably this behavior has been studied to avoid to use parallel bar to go back in the level in some situations, anyway if you want to do work in same way the bar, indifferently by current facing, you can customize the bat with the PB_DOUBLE_FACE flag.

PB_SHOW_CHARGE_BAR:$0010  ;Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.>This flag works only when you set also the flag PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE.>Since when the PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE flag is enabled, lara is able to increase the powerness of jump turning many times, you can enable with PB_SHOW_CHARGE_BAR the view of progress bar with current jump power.>It's advisable to add this feature because otherwise the player could have some difficulties to understand how much turns he made until that moment.

PB_SHOW_CHARGE_COUNTER:$0020  ;Used in Customize=CUST_PARALLEL_BARS.>This flag works only when you set also the flag PB_PROGRESSIVE_CHARGE>The charge counter is a text showing the currnet number of turns. If you use this flag the counter text will printed on screen while lara is turning on the bar.>You can use this flag also togheter with PB_SHOW_CHARGE_BAR if you wish.>>Remark: the source of charge counter text is always the PSX string with index = 220.>If you want change the text or create an other language version for it you can do, just you remember to use alwasy the PSX 220 string and to let always the formatter "%02d" in some point of the text because that formatter will be replaced with current number of turns.


BAR_HEALTH:0   ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR
BAR_DASH:1    ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR
BAR_AIR:2     ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR
BAR_LOAD_LEVEL:3 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR

BAR_CUSTOM1:4 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command.>The Custom bar is different by other health, dash, air  bars, because in this case there is no predefined target for it.>This is a free bar you can use for you new skills.>In the Customize= command you set the size and colors like for other bars, the only difference is that in (final) extra field you have to type a Variable Placefolder to identify the value used by your custom bar.>For example if you want the bar shows the value of Local Byte Delta1 variable you'll type as Extra field the value #0048 (see Variable placefolder list in Reference panel of NG_Center) and everytime you'll show the bar with some flipeffect the value used will be get by Local Byte Delta1.>When you want clear the custom bar just you set 0 in Local Byte Delta1, ect.>The custom bars have the full value with 100 and the empty value with 0, anyway using variables you can modify the source value to get correct values.>For example, if you have your original value that could be in the range 0 - 1000 (that is different by default range 0 - 100) just you divide your original value by 10 before showing the bar.>When you need of this pre-compute it's better don't set as variable for custom bar the your real variable but another variable, like Current Value variable, and then you'll perform the compute and you copy the result in Current Value and then you show the bar.>Using the flipeffects for variables it's easy adjust your source value with 0 - 100 range. Another example could be if you want have an inverse bar, where the bar if fully filled when the value is 0 and it is empty when the value is 100.>In this case the compute to perform will be: 100 - {My original value} = {value to put in bar variable).>Remarks: >- If you want add a text to describe the mean of your custom bar you have to use the flag FBAR_SHOW_BAR_NAME. See the description of this flag for more inos.>- Once you showed your custom bar, it's not necessary peform another show bar flipeffect everytime you update the bar value, just simply you change the bar variable and the bar will show new updated value byself.

BAR_CUSTOM2:5 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>Set the second customizable bar. See the description of BAR_CUSTOM1 constant for more informations about customize bars.

BAR_CUSTOM3:6 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>Set the third customizable bar. See the description of BAR_CUSTOM1 constant for more informations about customize bars.

BAR_CUSTOM4:7 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>Set the fourth customizable bar. See the description of BAR_CUSTOM1 constant for more informations about customize bars.

BAR_DAMAGE:8 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>Customize the bar showed in damage rooms.>Pease, note that damage bar color could be changed also in Damage= script command. Trng will use color of Damage command in the case you type IGNORE in Color1 field of bar in CUST_BAR command.

BAR_COLD:9  ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>Customize the bar showed in cold water rooms.>Pease, note that damage bar color could be changed also in Damage= script command. Trng will use color of Damage command in the case you type IGNORE in Color1 field of bar in CUST_BAR command.



FBAR_SOUND_BAR_ANIM:$0001  ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command. This flag creates in current bar a floating colors like you see in audio bar in Options screen.>When you use this flag you can also type in Extra field an IdColor (pointing to some ColorRGB= command) to set the mask color.>The audio bar works in particular way: there is a floating effect using two colors, the MainColor (IdColor1) and the background color (IdColor2), while the mask color will be used to paint the full side of bar. >For example if you use this flag with BAR_HEALTH and lara has 50 % of HP, the left half of bar will be colored with MaskColor to differentiate by right (empty) half.>The mask color doesn't paint fully the bar but it will be added to current floating effect.>For example if you set as MaskColor the rgb, with 0,0,0 values, you'll get no difference between left side and right side of bar because adding the 0,0,0, nothing change.>While if you set like mask color the white, with rgb values 255,255,255, the full side of bar will become fully white, losing the floating effect.>For above reasons it is a bit complicated set a good maskcolor. You should try a mask color where the rgb value was not 0 but neither 255. For example a color like: 128,128,128 (this is the default mask color if you type IGNORE in extra field), or  63,63,63  (it used in tomb4 for audio bar in some circustances)

FBAR_SHOW_BAR_NAME:$0002 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>This flag works only for custom bars (BAR_CUSTOM1/2/3/4)>If add this flag to FBAR field of customize command, everytime the bar will be showed the engine will draw also the wished text under the bar.>The texts to use are prefixed:>>BAR_CUSTOM1 : Extra NG String with index = 301>BAR_CUSTOM2 : Extra NG String with index = 302>BAR_CUSTOM3 : Extra NG String with index = 303>BAR_CUSTOM4 : Extra NG String with index = 304>>For example if you add a text for BAR_CUSTOM1 you have to add the FBAR_SHOW_BAR_NAME flag in customize command for BAR_CUSTOM1 and the in Extra NG list add a text like this:>>301: Jumping Power>>Removing the previous index showed when you click on [Add string] button.

FBAR_USED_FOR_BOAT_FUEL:$0004 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>When you set in boat ocbs the values: 32 (Fuel management) + 128 (show fuel bar), you have to set a customize script command to prepare the fuel bar to show on screen.>The fuel bar is always the BAR_CUSTOM4 bar.>You can type this customize command as usual, but with two differences:>>1) To the flags you have to add the FBAR_USED_FOR_BOAT_FUEL flag.>>2) In the extra field of customize, you have to type the max value for fuel, i.e. the value when the boat has a full fuel and it will correspond to full bar on screen.>>This value, to type in extra field, works in this way.>The fuel of the boat is, pratically, the number of frame tick for the operating time of the boat.>Everytime the boat engine is working this fuel/time will be decreased by 1 for each frame tick, when it reaches 0, the engine boat will switched off and the fuel bar will be empty.>Please note that, when the boat is running in turbo mode, the fuel will be decreased by 2 units.>>Since frame ticks are 30 for seconds, to give as full fuel an operating time of 15 minutes, you should type the value 30*60*15 = 27000>>Notes:>- The max value you can type in this field in 65534 that corresponds to >about 36 minutes. In the game times this is a huge time, probably you'll use a very lower value.>- Remember that the fuel management for boat uses, in hardcoded mode, the local long Delta variable (#0072) to store the current fuel of the boat. You can use this variable to show on screen the remaining time, or, converting it in litres, a representation of current litres in the boat tank.>You can also using triggers to increase or decrease the current fuel.
 
FBAR_DRAW_ALWAYS:$0008 ;Used in Customize=CUST_BAR command>This flag will keep always on screen the current bar.>The FBAR_DRAW_ALWAYS flag doesn't work with all bars. >You can use it with:>BAR_HEALTH>BAR_DASH>BAR_AIR>BAR_DAMAGE>BAR_COLD

CDM_NO_SAVE:1  ;Used by Customize=CUST_CD_SINGLE_PLAYBACK.>Using this setting the further single-playback cd will be ignored in saving game and when player will reload that savegame the single cd will be not played.

CDM_RESTORE_FROM_MIDDLE:2  ;Used by Customize=CUST_CD_SINGLE_PLAYBACK.>This is the default behavior. If you don't set any CUST_CD_SINGLE_PLAYBACK customize in your script.dat the TRNG engine will work using the CDM_RESTORE_FROM_MIDDLE.>With this setting the sound will be saved remembering its current position and it will be restore playing it from that precise position.

CDM_RESTORE_FROM_BEGIN:3  ;Used by Customize=CUST_CD_SINGLE_PLAYBACK>This settin force trng engine to save the single-playback cd and restore it but always from begin and not from the effective position it had while the game had been saved.>This setting it's adivsable for little and meaningful audio track, like a sound where lara was speaking.

TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX:$0001  ;Used with to force to use the index of last moveable detected by some condition. >The found index will be used in all following triggers or conditions of TriggerGroup that require an index for moveable.>Pratically using this flag, the index found from some condition will become the index to use for following condition and triggers, ignoring further moveable index of thoose triggers.>This overriding of original indices will be stopped only when it will be found another TGROUP_ flags used to change the default index of moveable to use.>>Other TGROUP_ flags to change the default index for moveable are:>TGROUP_USE_OWNER_ANIM_ITEM_INDEX >TGROUP_USE_TRIGGER_ITEM_INDEX>See descriptions of above flags.>Remark. Not all condition trigger may be used to set a moveable index, of course.>You can add the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX to (first value) of exported condition, only on those condition try to verify the presence of some moveable. >For example the condition trigger "Lara collides with moveable with [&] slot"  or the ENV condition "Lara has in front the object with slot = ExtraSlot">This method to force another index to use with following triggers it's necessary to handle situation where you are not able to know exactly WHAT moveable lara will collide or she'll have in front of her.>For example if we could build a TriggerGroup to handle a fighting like following:>>Conditions: "When right hand of lara touch head of [&] slot moveable">   then: (above condition is true)  Toggle vitalty to current enemy moveable>>In above trigger group, when we build our condition trigger we can set the slot of moveable for condition, for example we could use the slot "95 SAS", but when in game lara hits a SAS moveable it could be one of many SAS preset in the level, and we cann't know its index while we build the condition trigger.>If we don't know the index, we cann't set in following trigger to toggle vitality.>>To solve above problems, there are some TGROUP_ flags used to get the index of moveable to use in dynamic way: when engine with some condition detects a moveable, it could use that index for following trigger.


TGROUP_USE_TRIGGER_ITEM_INDEX:$0002   ;Set newly as index of moveable to use for following (and current) triggers, the real source index set in exported trigger.>This flag requires to be used only when you had changed the default index in previous triggers or conditions. Differently, if you have never used any TGROUP flag to modify the index to use, it's not necessary use this flag, because by default the index of moveabl is that set in data of exported trigger.>See also description of TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag to have more informations about the mechanism of changing of moveable index

TGROUP_USE_OWNER_ANIM_ITEM_INDEX:$0004  ;Set as moveable index to use in following (and current) triggers the index of moveable own the anim command just performed.>This flag could be used only when current TriggerGroup command has been started by an animcommand. In this situation, if you use this flag the index of moveable to use it will be the index of moveable owns the animation that contains the anim command started current TriggerGroup.>See also description of TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag to have more informations about the mechanism of changing of moveable index

TGROUP_AND:$0000  ;Set as operator for current condition the AND operator.>Note: The TGROUP_AND is currently unused from 1.2.2.7 dll version. To have an AND operator just avoiding to use TGROUP_OR and TGROUP_NOT.>>This operator will be keeped also for following condition trigger if no other TGROUP_ flag for boolean operators will be used.>The AND operation is the default operation, this means that, if you don't use any TGROUP flags to set operators in TriggerGroup, all condition will be linked with AND operators.>>Example of list of conditions + boolena operators:>>  Condition1>  TGROUP_OR + Condition2>  TGROUP_AND + Condition3>  TGROUP_NOT + Condition4>>Above list of condition triggers could be read in this way:>>if (Condition1 OR Condition2) is TRUE  AND>	Condition3 is true  AND >	Condition4 is NOT true  >	then ... perform following (non-conditional) trigger sequence

TGROUP_OR:$0010 ;Set as operator, to link current condition with previous conditions, the OR operator. >When you use the OR this means that just the previous condition or current condition are true to get true the condition group upto now.>See description of TGROUP_AND flag to have more information about the usage of boolean operators in TriggerGroup.

TGROUP_NOT:$0020 ;Set as operator, to link current condition with previous conditions, the NOT operator.>The NOT operator could be read as "AND NOT" because requires the previous condition was TRUE and that the current condition was NOT true.>You use the NOT operator to invert a condition, this is very useful to create condition not yet presents in trigger condition list.>For example if there is in trigger window the condition "Lara collide with object <#>" but it's missing the inverse condition "Lara is NOT colliding with object <#>", you can use the condition for collide and then add a TGROUP_NOT flag to first value of that exported condition to transforme it in "Lara is NOT colliding with object">See description of TGROUP_AND flag to have more information about the usage of boolean operators in TriggerGroup.

TGROUP_ELSE:$0040 ;Set the start of a ELSE group in current TriggerGroup.>The ELSE is important to perform an alternative trigger when the first condition was false.>For example if you create a TriggerGroup with conditions to load a different level in according with some condition, you can create a TriggerGroup like following:>>	Condition1 is true>		Perform trigger "Load level 4" >	else>		Perform trigger "Load title level">>Above conditional sentence could be use to perform a bonus level (4) only when some condition (condition1) is true, while is the condition is false (else) it will load the title level, to complete the adventure with no bonus level.>>You can place one, two or more ELSE in your TriggerGroup, the rule to follow to understand how the TriggerGroup will work, is:>>   If first conditions are true: perform first group of non conditional trigger immediatly following the first conditons.>   While if first conditions are false, skip all following non conditional trigger, until to reach an ELSE flag. >	If some ELSE flag has been found, the parsing will start from that condition/trigger as it was the start of whole TriggerGroup.>The trigger with ELSE flag could be also another condition, and it will be elaborated in usually method: if conditions are true perform following non conditional triggers, while if the conditions are false, skip all triggers upto another ELSE flag.>>Using multiple ELSE you can perform different triggers in according with many different conditions.>For example, we could open different doors in according with last number typed in Keypad switch:>>   Condition: If KeyPad Value = 1>		Trigger: Open door 12>   ELSE>	  Condition: if KeyPad Value=2>		Trigger: Open door 7>   ELSE>	  Condition: If keypad Value =3>		Trigger: open door 18

TGROUP_USE_EXECUTOR_ITEM_INDEX:$0100 ;Used in TriggerGroup command.>Adding this flag to first of triplex parameter of exported trigger data, you can replace the index on that perform some action, with the item that has excutes the trigger that enables this triggergroup.>You could use this flag when you create an heavy trigger to perform this triggergroup and you want that all action trigger will be redirect to moveable that has just enabled the trigger group.>For example if you export an action trigger to kill (any) moveable, and then you perorm this triggergroup with an heavy trigger, when any moveable move on it, the action (to kill) will be applied on this moveable.>Pratically with this method you can create trigger to kill enemies (or other action on them) where it will be the same moveable to enable it.>Remark: to realize this trick is problem you need to use also an Enemy= command with the NEF_EASY_HEAVY_ENABLING to permit to many different moveables to enable all heavy triggers they meet in their path.

TGROUP_SINGLE_SHOT:$0400 ;Used in TriggerGroup command>Adding this flag in first number of first trigger of TriggerGroup you create a single-shot Trigger group.>>Pratically this triggergroup will be performed only once in current level, indifferently by how much times for it, it will be required an execution with the "Perfrom TriggerGroup" flipeffect.>>The single-shot trigger groups are very important to fix that limitation about the trigger zone where you place same trigger in two or more closed sectors in the map. >When you wish that all this trigger zone worked like a single-shot trigger you have a problem, because each trigger will work in one-shot way but individually and this means that lara could engages newly the same trigger when she will touches another sector in that trigger zone.>Currnetly the only way to avoid this problem is to export the trigger in script format and copy it in a TriggerGroup command. Then add to first number the TGROUP_SINGLE_SHOT flag, and at end replace in the level the original trigger with a "perform trigger group" flipeffect. >In this way the triggergroup will be performed only once, and when lara will pass over other trigger sectors of that same zone, noting will happen.>>Remark: There is also a new flipeffect whereby it you can enable newly a single-shot triggergroup already performed.

TGROUP_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED:$0008 ;Used in TriggerGroup command>This flag works alike the TGROUP_SINGLE_SHOT flag (see its description) but in this case it's not necessary use the flipeffect 345 to enable it newly.>In fact, a triggergroup with the TGROUP_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED in (first) flags word, will be enabled newly not just the current triggergroup stops to be performed. This means that the "single shot" atttribute will work only in contiguos triggered sectors, but not just lara goes out from this trigger zone, the trigger will be newly ready for further performings.


TGROUP_USE_ITEM_USED_BY_LARA_INDEX:$0800 ;Used in TriggerGroup command>Using this flag you ovverride the original item index of the exported action trigger, with the index of last item that lara used (or she is using) in interactive mode.>>For example the index could be one of following moveables:>Vehicles, rope, polerope, switch 1/2/3, pushable objects, rollingball (with pusing features), parallel bar, elevator, keypad.>>Remark: for technical reasons this index remains valid also when lara stopped to use it. For example when lara drives the jeep, the index of jeep becomes the item_used_by_lara and when lara goes off from jeep it remains valid until lara doesnt' use another interactive item, like switch, elevator, parallel bar ect.>For above reason you should use this exported script ONLY calling it from an animcommand in a specific lara animation that interactes with that specific item.>>Example:>>You wish add a fire to parallel bar only when lara is using it.>To perform above target you should:>>1) Type in script text an AddEffect with data compatible with the moveable parallel bar>2) Export in script mode an action trigger to enable the above addeffect. Note that in this trigger it's not important the moveable you use for it since it will be override from our TGROUP_USE_ITEM_USED_BY_LARA_INDEX flag.>3) Type the data of exported action trigger in the script and add to its first value the TGROUP_USE_ITEM_USED_BY_LARA_INDEX flag>4) Now export, as animcommand, a trigger to perform # trigger group, using the id of our triggergroup to add the fire effect>5) Type the data of this animcommand in some frame of some lara animation used to roll around the parallel bar.>>In this way when lara will begin to use a parallel bar, that bar (and only that) it will be fired.>The you could use another action trigger to finish the fire effect with same method just showed but in this case we'll insert the animcommand in a frame of an animation where lara is going off from the parallel bar.>>With this method you can add effect or perform action triggers on all objects used  by lara with interesting effects.

TGROUP_COMMAND:3  ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>Differently by other TGROUP_ values, the TGROUP_COMMAND value should be used alone(*) to introduce a fake trigger.>Usually in triggergroups there are data about real triggers exported by NGLE program, but in the case of TGROUP_COMMAND it used only to set a command to handle the execution of (others) triggers in current triggergroup.>Once you typed the TGROUP_COMMAND value in first value of three values, you'll set in second value a TCMD (Triggergroup CoMmandD constant) to set what kind of command it will be. While the third value will be the argument for given TCMD_ command.>See also description of TCMD_ constants for more infos.>>(*) Note: The only exception, for the rule to use alone the TGROUP_COMMAND, is for TGROUP_ELSE flag, that you can add to TGROUP_COMMAND when it is first trigger of an ELSE block.>No other TGROUP_ flag can be added to TGROUP_COMMAND. >In the case you use a TGROUP_COMMAND with TCMD_SET... command to modify a condition trigger, the further TGROUP_OR / TGROUP_AND / TGROUP_NOT operators, should be always added to real (following) condition trigger, never to TGROUP_COMMAND fake trigger.


TCMD_GOTO:1  ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This value will be used in second (of three) values.>First value had to be the TGROUP_COMMAND constant.>The  TCMD_GOTO constant forces a jump to other trigger in same triggergroup command.>The third value will be the index of trigger (group of three values) to perform.>>Example:>>TriggerGroup=	1, $5000, 118, $2A,              ;0 index>			   TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_GOTO, 3  ;1 index, jmp to trigger "$2000, 406, $1">			   $5000, 137, $0129,            ;2 index>			   $2000, 406, $1                ;3 index>>Using GOTO you can getting easier some triggergroups  when you manage complicated sequence of IF ELSE conditional groups.>For instance, now we see, in natural language, a sequence of conditons and commands in this triggergroup:>>TriggerGroup=Id, ACondition ; 0>  			 	TriggerA1  ; 1>			 	TriggerA2  ; 2>			 ELSE BCondition ; 3>				TriggerB1  ; 4>				TriggerB2  ; 5>			TriggerC1  ; 6>			TriggerC2  ; 7>			TriggerC3  ; 8>>Above is an, only simbolic, description of a triggergroup. Where you read "Condition" there will be three value for some exported conditional trigger, while where you read some "Trigger..", there are three values for some exported trigger.>Now, we suppose to wish perform TriggerA1/2 when ACondition is true and TriggerB1/2 when BCondition is true, like it appears in above triggergroup. But, let's say, we wish perform the C1/2/3 triggers, in all cases, after TriggerA1/A2 and after (how already it happens)  TriggerB1/2.>In last release of trng, it was possible in only one way: duplicating the TriggerC1/2/3 in this way:>>TriggerGroup=Id, ACondition ; 0>			 	TriggerA1  ; 1>			 	TriggerA2  ; 2>				TriggerC1  ; 3>				TriggerC2  ; 4>				TriggerC3  ; 5>			 ELSE BCondition ; 6>				TriggerB1  ; 7>				TriggerB2  ; 8>				TriggerC1  ; 9>				TriggerC2  ; 10>				TriggerC3  ; 11>>It happened because, after a condition, it will be performed ONLY the triggers after that condition, and first of next ELSE statement. >When the execution entered in "ACondition is true" the execution stopped at next found ELSE.>Now, using GOTO command we can passing over this limit, in this way:>>TriggerGroup=Id, ACondition ; 0>			 	TriggerA1  ; 1>			 	TriggerA2  ; 2>			 	COMMAND GOTO  7 ;3>			 ELSE BCondition ; 4>				TriggerB1  ; 5>				TriggerB2  ; 6>			TriggerC1  ; 7>			TriggerC2  ; 8>			TriggerC3  ; 9>In above way, when the ACondition is true, it will be executed the TriggerA1/2 and then (the goto) also the TriggerC1/2/3, avoiding to have to duplicate them.> >From above example we discover that the GOTO command will be used very often first of an ELSE statement, to go on to execute other triggers below, in the triggergroup.>Anyway there is another new approach that we can having with GOTO command.>>In past trng versions, the execution of triggers, inside a given TriggerGroup, was only from top (first row) to bottom (last row) with further skipping of some trigger in according with result of some conditions.>Now, using GOTO you can perform newly a previous trigger, generating a "loop">When you use this chance you should take care to avoid endless loops, otherwise the game will freeze.>There are two situations where you can use loops (whereby "goto" commands) with no trouble:>>1) When you use a variable (trng variable) to keep track of number of cycles (amount of times) that you performed same triggers. In this method you'll have to insert in the cycle a condition to verify if it is the moment to quit the loop.>This method is very used to manage the arrays (vectors). In spite there is no yet many stuff about array management in NG_Center or triggers, these new skills could be added in future.>We see a little (meaningless) example:>>TriggerGroup= Id,  Set A1=0	; 0  >			   TriggerAlfa	; 1>			   TriggerBeta  ; 2>			   TriggerDelta ; 3>			   A1=A1+1		; 4>			   If A1 less or even than 4     ; 5>				   COMMAND GOTO 1   ; 6>			   ELSE TriggerGamma    ; 7>				   TriggerOmega    ; 8>Above is a loop, where the group of triggers (Alfa, beta and delta) will be executed four times and, at end of this cycle, it will be perfomed the Triggers Gamma and Omega.>If you follow the execution and keep in mind the value of A1, modified by "A1=A1+1" and then checked by "IF AI less or even than 4" condition, you should understand because Alfa,beta and delta triggers will be performed 4 times.>>Note: please, don't try to use a loop to move items on screen, or to wait a condition different than trng variables or memory zones you change in the loop, otherwise the game will freeze. The right way to perform continuosly a triggergroup is to use, from a trigger in the level, an activation Perform Always. Trying to get same result with a cycle based on GOTO command will fail, because the game requires to draw meshes, read input command from keyboard and other stuff, to work fine, it cann't be stopped, in an endless cycle, inside a triggergroup.>>2) When you want "recycle" some serie of triggers you typed above in a huge triggergroup.>This situation is alike to that already showed to skip ELSE statement, only difference is that you could use goto also to come back, to some previous trigger block, if you wish.


TCMD_EXIT:2  ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constants should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>The TCMD_EXIT command quit the execution of current triggergroup, returning as result the value you type in third (and next) argument.>About this returned value it can be "TRUE" or "FALSE".>In conditional triggergroups you use can set the final result of current triggergroup condition. If you set "TRUE" as next argument the condition will be true, while with FALSE will be false, of course.>Note: also when the Triggergroup, where you use a TCMD_EXIT command, is NOT a condition but only a serie to triggers to affect some effect in game, you HAVE to return a value as third argument and, in the case of not conditional triggergroups, you have to set always TRUE.>>Examples:>The triple values:>	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_EXIT, TRUE>will quit the execution of curren triggergroup, returning "true". Therefore, if current triggergroup was a conditon, the condition will be true.>>The triple values:>	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_EXIT, FALSE>will quit the execution of curren triggergroup, returning "true". Therefore, current triggergroup was a conditon and the condition will be false.

TCMD_SET_TIMER:3 ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>It changes the following (real) trigger, of current TriggerGroup, replacing the Timer value with that taken from trng variable set in next value (third value of curren command trigger).>>Range: 0/255 >Scope: Used only with Flipeffects, it is the "Timer (Parameter (&)) parameter.
 

TCMD_SET_FULL_TIMER:4  ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>It changes the following (real) trigger of current TriggerGroup, replacing the Full Timer value with that taken from trng variable set in next value (third value of curren command trigger).>>Range: 0/32767>Scope: Used only with Flipeffects having NO (E)xtra parameter.

TCMD_SET_EXTRA_TIMER:5 ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>It changes the following (real) trigger of current TriggerGroup, replacing the (E) Extra Timer value with that taken from trng variable set in next value (third value of current command trigger).>>Range: 0/127>Scope: Used with Flipeffects and Action triggers. It is the "(E)xtra" parameter.>  >I'll do only a pair of examples about this command, anyway same speech could work also for other TCMD_SET_... commands.>>First Example: change the time to self-closing of a door, in according with number of found secrets.>In game-play this means: ok, you (player) could not give a ship (censored) about looking for secrets but... I advise you that, at end of the level you'll have more time to reach the final exit-door if you picked up many secrets.>>About the triggergroup to realise this target it will be based on trigger (to modify dinamically with TGROUP_COMMAND) like this:>>; Set Trigger Type - ACTION 43>; Exporting: TRIGGER(1323:0) for ACTION(175) {Tomb_NextGeneration}>; (#) : DOOR_TYPE1                 ID 175    in sector (2,2) of Room 0>; (&) : Trigger.

Move up (#)animating for (E) clicks>; (E) :   1 clicks  >; Values to add in script command: $5000, 4, $1E>>And we'll use a bridge as animating to move.>>Then, in the TriggerGroup, we'll set the TGROUP_COMMAND to change the Extra timer of above trigger, using the variable where  we saved the computation: LastInputNumber * (some factor, the number of clicks for floor).

TCMD_SET_EXTRA_CONDITION:6   ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>It changes the following (real) trigger of current TriggerGroup, replacing the Extra Timer value with that taken from trng variable set in next value (third value of current command trigger)>>Range: 0/31>Scope: Used only with Conditional trigger.

TCMD_SET_OBJECT:7 ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>It changes the following (real) trigger of current TriggerGroup, replacing the Object value with that taken from trng variable set in next value (third value of current command trigger).>>Range: 0/4095 or 0/-4095 (see below note)>Scope: Used with Condition and Action triggers. It is the "(Object to trigger (#))" parameter.>>Note: if the value is a moveable index, remember that there are two kinds of indices about moveables:>1) The index in tr4 file, used in run-time.>2) The NGLE index, that is the index you see in NGLE room editor.>You can set one or other kind but it's necessary you use the negative sign (-) to declare a tr4 moveable index when you used a tomb4 index. In this case the range becomes -1/-4096>While, if the value in source variable is positive, it should be a ngle a tomb (tr4) moveable index or another kind of paramater, different than moveable indices.>About this complication it's necessary reminding that the exported trigger used always ngle indices for moveables, for this reason if you have, in some trng variable, an internal tr4 index, you'll have to change its sign before passing it to some exported trigger with TCMD_SET_OBJECT command.>All above speech is futile if,  the object value to change, it's not really the index of some moveable but some other type of parameter.

TCMD_LOG:8  ;  Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>Used only for script debugging.>With this command you can enable or disable the log, like you had changed the script command:>>DiagnosticType= DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS, EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG>>In next value, third argument, you'll type ENABLED to enable the log, or DISABLED, to disable the log.>Please note that this command is not able to enable/disable the diagnostics but only the DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS flag.>This means that you should use it in this way:>Type in [Options] section of the script the commands:>>Diagnostic= ENABLED>DiagnosticType= 0, EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG>>note: you can also type some other DGX_ value instead by inserting "0". Anyway the point is that you omit to insert the "DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS" flag.>>Then, in the triggergroup whose you want have the log, you'll type as first trigger:>>	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_LOG, ENABLED>and at end of the triggergroup (if you wish) you can disable the log:>	TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_LOG, DISABLED>In this way you can remove most of log messages about script commands whose you are not interested, to clean up the log.>>Note: this command cann't remove the system log messages, about loading level, creation of lights ect. It affects only log messages about script commands.

TCMD_PAUSE:9  ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>Suggested only for script debugging.>With this command you can force a pause in game when this command trigger will be performed.>Only reason to use this chance is to verify (watching the screen) what's happening in game in that precise moment.>The usage in game-play (and therefore, not for debugging purpose) it's possible but a bit weird. If you wish freezing the game and wait a key from player, you have already some flipeffects to show strings.>>You have two ways to perform the pause:>Setting in next argument (third value of this command trigger) the number of microseconds for the pause, and, elapsed this time, the game will come back to run, or setting a scan code (you take the value in "Keyboard scancode list" of Ng_Center's reference panel).>When you set a scan code the pause will go on forever, until the user will hit that key.>To recognize scan codes from microseconds you use the sign.>Negative numbers will be seen as microseconds to wait, while a positive value as a scan code to be hit to quit the pause.

TCMD_TIMER_FIELD:10  ;Used in TriggerGroup= command.>This constant should be used as second value of three values, where the first was TGROUP_COMMAND.>This command set in global timer variable the value (in seconds) typed in next argument (and third value of this command trigger).>Please do not confuse this command with the other script commands like "TCMD_SET_FULL_TIMER" or "TCMD_SET_EXTRA_TIMER".>There is a big difference: while both TCMD_SET_... commands will change the "timer/extra timer" argument of following trigger in triggergroup sequence, the TCMD_TIMER_FIELD command will NOT change any argument of following triggers, but it will store the "real timer value in seconds to use" for (*)all next triggers in current triggergroup.>>To explain better the difference, just thinking to use an Action trigger like A43: "Trigger. (Moveable) Activate (#)Object with (E)Timer value".>Above trigger has its own (extra)timer field, and you could change it using the TCMD_SET_EXTRA_TIMER command. >Anyway the max value to store in (E)timer argument is 127 and, using signed values, the range will be: -64/+63>So, using TCMD_SET_EXTRA_TIMER command, you could set only a limited time in seconds for that trigger.>Differently, using TCMD_TIMER_FIELD command, you can pre-set for all timer usage in next triggers a (**)bigger value, like 1000 or -800.>Warning: please notice that the TCMD_TIMER_FIELD command will affect (*)ALL following trigger using a timer value (and not only that next trigger), so you could get unwished results if there are more than one trigger using a "timer value" in the triggergroup sequence.>In above situation there is a trick to disable the previous timer_field set value: just using another TCMD_TIMER_FIELD (before of trigger you want skip from timer_field value) with a 0 number of seconds and in this way the following triggers will not use the value set with (first) TCMD_TIMER_FIELD command and they will come back to use their own timer value set in the triggers.>>(*) Note: really the only triggers that will be affected by this command are those action triggers used to trigger objects (like traditional tomb trigger) but with the chance to be exported (since they are trng Action trigger).>Since only action trigger that use really the timer value for activation, will use the value set with TCMD_TIMER_FIELD, the affected triggers will be only the A26, A41, A43 and A44 action triggers.>>(**) Note: The values you can use as number of seconds has to be in the range: -1092 / + 1092 (about 18 minutes)>>TRUE:1   ;Used as argument for TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_EXIT  command trigger>>FALSE:0  ;Used as argument for TGROUP_COMMAND, TCMD_EXIT  command trigger

GT_USED_INVENTORY_ITEM:1  ;With this global trigger you can detect when the player chooses a specifc item from inventory. You have to specify the slot id in following field  named Parameter.>For example to enable a global trigger when player select the QUEST_ITEM2 with slotid = 253, you can type "GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_USED_INVENTORY_ITEM , 253, ...".>>Remarks: >*If you want remove the chosen item from inventory when global trigger has been engaged you have to insert in perform TriggerGroup the specific flipeffect "Inventory-Item. Remove <&>inventory-item from inventory". If you don't use this flipeffect the selected item will remain in inventory for further activations.>>*Please, try to avoid to use QUEST_ITEM1 for your global trigger because QUEST_ITEM1 is used already for Detector activation.

GT_SCREEN_TIMER_REACHED:2  ;You can start your global trigger when screen timer reach the supplied number of seconds. You have to type the number of seconds in following field named Parameter.>For example, to start your trigger when timer screen reach 240 seconds (4 minutes) you can type: "GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_SCREEN_TIMER_REACHED, 240, ...">Remark: >* For this global trigger is strongly suggested to use flag FGT_SINGLE_SHOT, otherwise it, when the condition becomes true,  will performed 30 times for second, forever.

GT_ENEMY_KILLED:3  ;You can specific in Parameter field the index of moveable to monitor. When the given moveable will be killed the global trigger will be started.>Remarks:>* You read the index of moveable when, in NGLE program, you perform a single mouse click on that object, the index will be showed in a yellow box.>* Theorically you can get a trigger activation when a creature dies also with local (common) trigger Switch. If you trigger enemy with a switch trigger and then add to this trigger some common trigge to enable doors, enemies ect, when the creature will die the trigger will be activated. Anyway the problem to use this method is that you have to cover a big surface with above triggers, because it's necessary the creature when he dies, he was on sectors with switch trigger. Differently using global trigger GT_ENEMY_KILLED the trigger will be activated indifferently by corrent position of enemy.>* For this global trigger is strongly suggested to use flag FGT_SINGLE_SHOT, otherwise it, when the condition becomes true,  will performed 30 times for second, forever.

GT_LARA_HP_LESS_THAN:4 ;This global trigger will be enabled when life bar of lara (Health value) is less than value you set in Parameter field.>Remember that the health value for lara in enclosed in range between 0 (she dies) and 1000 (full line and no bar showed in game).>For example if you want reduce some capabilities of lara when she has a life less than 100 hp, you can type a GlobalTrigger like this:>>GlobalTrigger=1, FGT_SINGLE_SHOT, GT_LARA_HP_LESS_THAN, 100, ...>>If you use a trigger like above to remove some capability of lara you should remember also to set some way to return these capabilities to lara when her hp grows newly over that limit (100), for example you can use GT_LARA_HP_HIGHER_THAN or GT_USED_BIG_MEDIPACK or GT_USED_LITTLE_MEDIPACK.

GT_LARA_HP_HIGHER_THAN:5 ;This global trigger will be enabled when life value for lara is higher than value you type in Parameter field. The valid range for lara vitality is between 0 - 999

GT_USED_BIG_MEDIPACK:6  ;Trigger enabled when lara select and use a big medipack.>Remark: if Lara has already full life and player select a big medipack from inventory the condition will be false, because in this situation the medipack will not really used.

GT_USED_LITTLE_MEDIPACK:7  ;Trigger enabled when lara select and use a little medipack.>Remark: if Lara has already full life and player select a little medipack from inventory the condition will be false, because in this situation the medipack will not really used.

GT_USING_BINOCULAR:8 ;Trigger enabled when lara is or not looking using binocular.>WARNING: you have to place a correct value in Paramter field. If you want check the condition for lara is using binocular you must type "128" or "$80" in Paramter field, while if you want check the condition for lara is NOT using binocular, you'll type the value 0 (zero) in Paramter field.

GT_DAMAGE_BAR_LESS_THAN:9 ;This global trigger check for level of damage and it will be checked only when lara is in a damage room.>You have to type the value to comparise in Paramater field.>In spite of type of progress bar chosen for damage room (increasing or decreasing bar) this condition will check the value of damage in same way: when lara is just entered in damage room the value of damage bar is 1000, while when she remains in damage room for some time the damage level will be littler upto 0, when lara will be damaged really or burned.>Pratically with low values the situation for lara is worse.

GT_LARA_POISONED:10  ;Condition about poisoned lara. When lara is poisoned the life bar becomes yellow and in short time the screen will be deformed.>Using this global trigger you can perform some action for example to show a text, when lara is poisoned.>In Paramater field you have to type the value used as comparison. The formula used is "IF POISON_IN_LARA grather than PARAMTER then ..." perform global trigger.>If you want that the global trigger was enable for any poison value, you can type 0 (zero) in parameter field.>DIfferently if you want the activation was only when the poison level is higher you can type a big value, like 400 or more.>Some infos about the level of poison:>Darts = 160>Little scorpion = 512 (only from 4th level)>Big scorpion = 2048>Start screen Harpy = 2048>Deforming screen when poison is higher than 256>Max level for poison = 4096


GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT:$40000000 ;Used in parameter field of GlobalTrigger command when you use GT_DISTANCE_FROM_ITEM or GT_DISTANCE_FROM_STATIC global triggers.>See the description of above global triggers for more infos.

GT_CONDITION_GROUP:11 ;If you don't want using a GT_ global trigger to test the condition, but you want use some common CONDITION triggers stored in some TriggerGroup command script, you have to use the value  GT_CONDITION_GROUP for GlobalTrigger field. With this value the engine will check immediatly only the conditions in trigger group you typed in IdConditionGroup field.>Remark: please don't confuse about usage of GT_CONDITION_GROUP value. You cann't add this value to other GT_ global trigger values. This value is used only when you don't want type any specific global trigger but you want to use only conditions of trigger group. Anyway, if you want use a global trigger (like GT_USED_LITTLE_MEDIPACK for example) and you want add also a condition group you can do this simply setting a valid IdTriggerGroup value in IdConditionGroup field.>Pratically the GT_CONDITION_GROUP used only to set a null-doing global trigger with a condition trigger group, because if you put IGNORE in GlobalTrigger field this global trigger will be never performed and the further IdConditionGroup it will be ignored, too.

GT_DISTANCE_FROM_ITEM:12 ;This global trigger permits to verify the distance between Lara and some moveable, when the distance is less than that set in Paramater field the trigger will be engaged.>Reamark: the value to type in Parameter field is a bit complex because it is the combination of two values: the index of moveable to check and the distance (in real units) to compare.>>Note: from 1.2.2.4 version the formula is different.>>The new formula to use is:>>MoveableIndex + (RealUnitDistance * 8192)>>For RealUnitDistance we mean the units used in the game, instead using the number of sectors or clicks.>For example, since one sector = 1024, and one click = 256, if you wish check the distance of two sectors the value will be 2048 and you type it in the formula for Parameter in this way:>>ItemIndex + 8192 * 2048>>Let say the itemindex = 307, the result will be:>>307 + 8192*2048 = 16777523>>The max value you can use as distance is 130048, that it is 127 sectors.>>This distance it will be computed with trigonometric precision as distance between the two 3d points  x,y,z  of Lara and x2,y2,z2 of Item.>>Anyway, if you wish ignore the different height (Y coordinates) you can add to the formula the constant value GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT>>For example in above example it will become:>>130048 + GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT>>A possible reason to use the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT mode, is when you wish having a fine precision on whole side of an object, like a column. In this case, if you omit the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT value and therefor the compute enclosed also the Y value, when lara is above of some click respect to the columne she will seem like more far from it because there is yet the distance between the y coordinate of Lara and the Y coordinate of column, on the base of the floor. >Differently, if you use the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT value the distance will be computed only in planar way.>Remark: when you use the GTD_IGNORE_HEIGHT value you should use also a conditional trigergroup to verify if Lara is in the correct room or in a correct height limit (vertical condition trigger) to avoid that the condition resulted true also when lara is many room over or below the item but only because she is in same x,z position in planar view.



GT_COLLIDE_ITEM:13  ;You can detect if lara is touching moveable with index you set in Parameter field.>For more infos read also the description of GT_COLLIDE_SLOT global trigger, and FGT_PUSHING_COLLISION flag

GT_COLLIDE_SLOT:14 ;This global trigger works like GT_COLLIDE_ITEM but in this case you have to type a slot number both a specific item index.>Pratically you can use GT_COLLIDE_SLOT to test the collision of Lara with any item of a given slot.>For example if you create this GlobalTrigger:>>GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_COLLIDE_SLOT, 41, ...>>Since 41 is the slot for BADDY_1 object, everytime lara will collide with any BADDY_1 object the global trigger will be engaged.>>Remark: When the collision will be detected, the item of moveable is colliding Lara, will be saved to be used from triggers stored in perform TriggerGroup. In particular way you have to use the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX togheter with some trigger that works on some moveable. For example if global trigger detect a collision with moveable with slot 41 (like in above example) and this moveable has the index = 132, this index will be used for each trigger in triggergroup where you set the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX.>See also description of TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag for more infos.>>This is a little example how the TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag work togheter with GT_COLLIDE_SLOT global trigger:>If you type following lines in your script.txt file:>>TriggerGroup=	1, $5000+TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX, 749, $E>GlobalTrigger=1, IGNORE, GT_COLLIDE_SLOT, 43, IGNORE, 1	>>Lara will kill each BADDY_2 enemy simply touch him.>The number 43 is the slot for BADDY_2, while the flag TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX in TriggerGroup command has been used to substitute the original target of that trigger (it was an Action trigger to kill a crocodile) with the index of moveable found in global trigger GT_COLLIDE_SLOT, i.e. the baddy2 was colliding Lara.


GT_COLLIDE_CREATURE:15  ;This global trigger works like GT_COLLIDE_SLOT but in this case the condition will be true for each moveable that is a "creature" type.>A creature is a moveable following AI rules, it's able to move byself.>Remark: this global trigger will ignore the value typed in Parameter field.

GT_LOADED_SAVEGAME:16  ;The condition will be true when player has just started the loading of a savegame from Load Game screen.

GT_SAVED_SAVEGAME:17  ;The condition will be true when player has just saved current game in some savegame.

GT_COLLIDE_STATIC_SLOT:18 ;The condition is true when lara touch a static of given static slot kind typed in Parameter field.>Remarks: >* Don't confuse the moveable slots with static slots. You find the static slots in the "Statics indices" list of  "Reference" panel > >* About the chance to perform a triggergroup when lara touches a specific static it's not necessary a global trigger: just you add in the ocb of that static the value 2048 and then place an heavy trigger in sector under that static. When lara will touch the static the heavy trigger will be performed.

GT_DISTANCE_FROM_STATIC:19 ;This global trigger permit to verify the distance between Lara and a specific static object, when the distance is less than that set in Paramater field the trigger will be engaged.>In the Parameter field you have to type the result of a formula including static index and the distance. See the descritpion of this formula in the GT_DISTANCE_FROM_ITEM mnemonic constant.


GT_LARA_HOLDS_ITEM:20 ;This global trigger is true when lara is holding in her hands the item you specified in Parameter field. The value set in Parameter could be also a vehicle or pole or rope.>Remark: in Parameter field cann't type a SLOT value but an HOLD_ constant.>You can find the list of available HOLD_ values in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS list of Reference panel.

GT_VSCROLL_COMPLETE:21 ;This global trigger is true when the vertical scrolling text of given string index has been completed.>In Parameter field you should type the index of extra ng string used for vertical scrolling text to monitor.>Remark: The most common usage of this global trigger is when you want create following operation:>Showing a long scrolling text on screen and freeze lara in the meanwhile disabling the keyboard input.>In this situation you can use this global trigger to enable newly the keyboard input when the scrolling text is complete.

GT_VSCROLL_LAST_VISIBLE:22 ;This global trigger will be true when last row of vertical scroll text is fully visible on screen.>Differently from GT_VSCROLL_COMPLETE, with GT_VSCROLL_LAST_VISIBLE the condition is true when vertical scroll is not yet completed but the last row of text entered in visible area of screen.>In Parameter field you have to type the index of NG string used for scrolling operation you want check.>You can use this global trigger to create a chain of different scrolling operations with different size and color of character.>For example you can create a text with a singe row using very big characters.>You'll use this single row as a big title of following scrolling text with littler size of text.>In above situation you can use a GT_VSCROLL_LAST_VISIBLE global trigger linked to title scrolling, to show the remaining text (other scrolling text) when the title is visible on screen. The final effect will be to watch a single long text using different size or color of character but in the reality it will be two different scrolling texts working in same moment.

GT_GAME_KEY1_COMMAND:23  ;The condition is true when the game command (jump, action, look ect) you set in Parameter field, it has been chosen from Player.>>You have to type in Parameter field the wish KEY1_.. game command to detect.>>You can also type a sum of many KEY1_ constants (see MNEMONIC CONSTANTS list) but you cann't type in this global trigger a KEY2_ constant. If you want detect a KEY2_ command then you should use the twin global trigger GT_GAME_KEY2_COMMAND.>>Remarks:>This condition is true not yet the game command has been sent, this means that the command has not been yet elaborated by game engine when the condition is true.>For example if the command is KEY1_JUMP, lara is not yet jumping.>For this reason, if you wish, you can also remove the game command, to prevent that the game engine can receive it, using the flag FGT_REMOVE_INPUT>See FGT_REMOVE_INPUT description for more infos.

GT_GAME_KEY2_COMMAND:24  ;This global trigger works in same way of GT_GAME_KEY1_COMMAND, but in this case you can set in Parameter field a KEY2_.. game command.>See description of GT_GAME_KEY1_COMMAND for more infos.

GT_KEYBOARD_CODE:25  ;This global trigger detect when player hit some specific keystroke.>You have to type the scan code value in Parameter field.>You can find all valid scan codes in Reference Panel of NG Center, in the KEYBOARD SCANCODES list.>>Remark:>This command should be not used to detect standard game command, you should use the GT_GAME_KEY1_COMMAND or GT_GAME_KEY2_COMMAND global triggers for this target. >In fact, you should remember that the keystrokes linked with game commands could be changed in Options screen from player, so you cann't to be sure that a given scan code was always the same to jump or roll.>Differently you should use GT_KEYBOARD_CODE trigger when you want have your custom hot key to start some extra feature. The scan code you choose should be different by all other keyboard commands that the player could choose in Options screen. For example you could select some unused function keys like F7 or F8 to start your operation.

GT_FMV_COMPLETED:26  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This global trigger will be engaged when the FMV with number typed in Parameter field has been just completed.>This global trigger is very useful when you wish change something in game only at end of a video-cutscene (FMV).>Usally you'll use a FMV to show some fact or actions about lara and for this reason it's probably you wish that, at end of movie, something in game was changed: like loading of new level, or enabling a flipmap or moving lara in other side of level.>In all above cirustances you should use this global trigger to be sure that the triggers (stored in a triggergroup called by this GlobalTrigger command) will be performed excactly at first frame following the ending of given FMV.

GT_TITLE_SCREEN:27  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This global trigger should be used only in [Title] section.>With GT_TITLE_SCREEN you can discover what kind of screen is showing in title phase: if main titles, new game, load game, or options.>You have to type in Parameter field a TSCR_ value for wished screen type.

GT_ELEVATOR_STOPS_AT_FLOOR:28  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This global trigger will be enabled when the given elevator has just stopped at given floor.>You could use this trigger to open a door in front of elevator.>You type the elevator index and the floor number in Parameter field.>Since you have to put two numbers is a single field it's necessary perform a little compute to compact the two numbers in a single number.>>The formula to get this unique number is:>>(FloorNumber * 4096) + ElevatorIndex>>You cann't type above row in that way, of course, because NG_Center doens't recognize the "*" multiply character or the parenthesis.>Differenty you have to perform the compute and then type only the final number.>For example if you want verify when the elevator with Index = 137, reachs the first floor (floornumber= 1), the compute will be:>>(1 * 4096) + 137>>and we'll get:>>4233>>Remarks: >>1) At start of the level all elevators will give the GT_ELEVATOR_STOPS_AT_FLOOR event with the floor number = 1, since all elevators have to begin with the cage at first floor.>In this way if you use this global trigger to have a door opened in front of the floor where is the elevator it will work also from start of the level.>>2) There is a limitation for both values to set in parameter field: >The elevator index cann't be greather than 4095>The floor number cann't be greather than 15>If you have to use number bigger than above limits you have a big problem, because the size of single field of GlobalTrigger script command don't permit to have number bigger than above limits.

GT_ELEVATOR_STARTS_FROM_FLOOR:29  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This condition verify when the given elevator has just let the given floor.>You have to type the elevator index and floor number in Parameter field.>About the mode to compact these two numbers in a single number, read the description of GT_ELEVATOR_STOPS_AT_FLOOR global trigger

GT_BEFORE_SAVING_VARIABLES:30 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This global trigger will be enabled an instant before trng engine saves the variables in savegame or in HUB section (used when lara steps to new level with a finish trigger).>In the Parameter field you type the level number where perform this trigger.>It's important set the correct level number because some operation to save and restore, you could have to do only on some levels but not on oters. >For xample if you did some variable poke to modify a moveable in level 1, it's important you save its value in a specific variable, different than you could do in oter level 2 where this moveable could be missing.>Remember that the store variables are all global variables and they will be changed and reloaded for all levels.>See also the tutorial for trng variables in zip file: trng_variables.zip>>You can use this global trigger to save in variables some value typed previously to change moveables or pyhsics of the game.>This operation it will be necessary only when your "poke" operation in some critical memory  it's only temporary and it will be lost when player reload a savegame. In this case you have to use this global trigger to save in some variables the changes, and then restore them with other global trigger: GT_AFTER_RELOADING_VARIABLES

GT_AFTER_RELOADING_VARIABLES:31 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This condition will be true when player has just loaded a savegame, or when lara enters in a new level using a finish trigger with no ResetHub command.>If you had saved some critical memory in variables with GT_BEFORE_SAVING_VARIABLES global trigger, you can now restore them, when the variables has been just reloaded, to create newly the same situation previously of saving game.>In Parameter field you type the level number after the reloading of game, about when perform this global trigger. So, if lara from level 1, touchs a finish trigger and she goes to level 2, you'll have to type the number "2" to reload from begin of this level.

GT_ALWAYS:32  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This is a special global trigger.>Usually a global trigger perform the wished TriggerGroup when it happened some specific global condition in the game.>Differently the GT_ALWAYS global trigger will be always performed (if it enabled), frame or frame of the game.>You can use this global trigger to have a triggergroup working endless.

GT_TRNG_G_TIMER_EQUALS:33 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>Enabled when the Global trng timer has same value set in Parameter field.>The value you type in Parameter field is in frame ticks, where 1 second = 30 frame ticks.>So if you want detect when a growing timer reaches 40 seconds you have to type "1200" , since 40 * 30 = 1200.>>Remark: This global trigger works ONLY while the respective timer is running, this means it's not necessary (and neiter advisable) to use FGT_SINGLE_SHOT or FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED flags.>In the case you wish check the variation of trng timer performed in a way different than standard flipeffect "Variables. Timer. Start the <&>TRNG Timer in (E)Mode" you should avoid these global triggers and use instead the GT_CONDITION_GROUP global trigger, placing in the ConditionTriggerGroup the id of a triggergroup with exported CONDITION triggers to test the content of variable TIMER.


GT_TRNG_L_TIMER_EQUALS:34 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>Enabled when the Local trng timer has same value set in Parameter field.>Read the description of GT_TRNG_G_TIMER_EQUALS global trigger for more infos.

GT_KEYPAD_SHOWED:35 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This trigger will be enabled when the KeyPad with index typed in Parameter field will be showed.>You could use this global trigger to show a text in the precise moment when the big editable keypad will be showed, to describe to player what is its target.

GT_KEYPAD_REMOVED:36 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This global trigger is the opposite than GT_KEYPAD_SHOWED flag.>When the (big) editable keypad will be removed this global trigger will be enabled.>You can use this global trigger to remove the further text show with the other global trigger GT_KEYPAD_SHOWED.

GT_NO_ACTION_ON_ITEM:37 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command.>This global trigger will be true when the supplied item has no trng action enabled on it.>You should type the index of the item to check, in the "Parameter" field of GlobalTrigger command.>The trng actions are procedures used to turn, move and get other time consuming effects on moveables.>Many Action triggers you find Set Trigger Type window, begin a progressive action on that moveable.>This global trigger could be useful to discover the exact moment when an item completed its movement, for example to play a sound effect, or syncronize another action starting when the first action has been completed.>>Remark: since this global trigger verify if the item has no action enabled on it, you should use for this global trigger the following flags:>>the FGT_DISABLED flag, to avoid it was immediatly engaged at begin of the level, since in that moment surely the item has no action in progress. So you should start with the global trigger disabled, thanks to FGT_DISABLED flag, and then you should enable the global trigger only after some action trigger has been started on it.>>the FGT_SINGLE_SHOT or FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED flags, because otherwise the triggergroup linked with this global trigger will be ontinuosly and forever performed after the last progressive action has been completed on the item.

GT_COMPLETED_SCALING_ON_ITEM:38  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command>This global trigger will be enabled when the item (static or moveable) with the index typed in the Parameter field of GlobalTrigger command, has been resized and its rescaling is complete.>Note: this global trigger works only for dynamic (but not endless) rescaling. Pratically when you perform a dynamic rescaling from percentage to percentage with a given resizing speed.

GT_SELECTED_INVENTORY_ITEM:39  ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command>This global trigger is similar to GT_USED_INVENTORY_ITEM but there are important differences.>While GT_USED_INVENTORY_ITEM works only with inventory items where there is no hardcoded feature and only when lara is still in stand up position, with the GT_SELECTED_INVENTORY_ITEM global trigger you detect the usage of the item, whose slot had been typed in Parameter field, first that tomb4 engine processes it.>>This fact implies some situations to remember:>>1) Since there is no check about current animation of lara or environment (ground, underwater, floating) it should be you, with some conditional triggergroup, to verify if it's possible in that moment using really that item.>For example, if your item should perform an animation where lara takes in her hand this item, you should verify with right conditions if lara has free hands and she is in a reasonable state-id to manage this situation.>>2) The global trigger will be engaged also when there is an hardcoded management like for the binocular, medipack, weapons, or also when there is no management but, usually the tomb refuses to manage directly that item, like it happens for lasersight item.>>In the case you wish replace the default management of that hardcoded item, with yours, you have to add in the flags of the GlobalTrigger command the FGT_REPLACE_MANAGEMENT flag.>See the description of FGT_REPLACE_MANAGEMENT flag for more infos.

GT_CREATED_NEW_ITEM:40 ;Used in GlobalTrigger= command>This global trigger will be enabled everytime in game it has been created an item with same slot you typed in Parameter field.>When the global trigger will be engaged the index of new created item (always a moveable) will be stored as found item index, and you can elaborate it adding to exported triggers the TGROUP_USE_FOUND_ITEM_INDEX flag.>I remember that the items that could be created are:>>FLARE_ITEM (when lara throw away it)>BURNING_TORCH_ITEM (when lara throw it. Note: it's not always "burning")>CLOCKWORK_BEETLE (when lara places it on the floor)>GRENADE (shot from Sas, from Lara and from enemy jeep)>DARTS (emitted from dart emitter. Warning: if you intercept this item you'll have a huge quantity of items to manage)>CROSSBOW_BOLT (shot from lara)>>while about the new created item with slots:>PISTOLS_ANIM  (*)>UZI_ANIM   (*)>SIXSHOOTER_ANIM (*)>SHOTGUN_ANIM  >CROSSBOW_ANIM>GRENADE_GUN_ANIM>>the matter is complicated to explain. >The hardcoded mangament of combat animations use a "fake" item only to store current animation, frame, state id of weapon animations, in spite the real item remains only main Lara.>Anyway when you detect the creation of some of above weapon lara slots, it means that lara is loading that kind of weapon and changing animation and frame in this new fake item I suppose you could be able to affect that combat animation.>(*)Note: It seems that the method of fake item created dynamically works only for shotgun, crossbow and grenade-gun weapons, while for other littlest weapons (*) the engine swaps simply the hand mesh with no new item created.>Note: if you wish try to manage weapon animation you can use this global trigger to detect the moment of extracted weapons, but to manage it you can use also new savegame memory variables beginning with "WeaponAnim" names. See trng variables triggers.
 
LOAD_AMMO_TYPE1:$0008 ;Used in Equipment command.>If your equipment command is working on a weapon slot (weapon, not ammo), you can add to the Amount field the LOAD_AMMO_TYPE1 flag to set that the ammo is currently loaded with normal ammo (ammo type 1)>Remark: pistol, revolver and UZI can use only ammo type 1. For Shotgun the ammo_type1 is the normal ammo.>>Example:>>Equipment=SHOTGUN_ITEM, 1+LOAD_AMMO_TYPE1>To set that the shotgun will be present in the inventoy and the loaded ammo will be normal ammo.>>If you omit the ammo type currently loaded in the weapon, the engine will use as default the ammo type 1 for that weapon.

LOAD_AMMO_TYPE2:$0010 ;Used in Equipment command.>If your equipment command is working on a weapon slot (weapon, not ammo), you can add to the Amount field the LOAD_AMMO_TYPE2 flag to set that the ammo is currently loaded with ammo type 2>The weapons: shotgun, crossbow and grenade gun, can use the ammo type2

LOAD_AMMO_TYPE3:$0020 ;Used in Equipment command.>If your equipment command is working on a weapon slot (weapon, not ammo), you can add to the Amount field the LOAD_AMMO_TYPE3 flag to set that the ammo is currently loaded with ammo type 3>The weapons: crossbow and grenade gun, can use the ammo type3

LOAD_LASERSIGHT:$0004 ;Used in Equipment command.>If your equipment command is working on a weapon slot (weapon, not ammo), you can add to the Amount field the LOAD_LASERSIGHT flag to set that the ammo has currently loaded the laser sight.>Note: Only revolver and crossbow can use laser sight.>>For example the scrit command:>>Equipment= CROSSBOW_ITEM, 1 + LOAD_LASERSIGHT + LOAD_AMMO_TYPE3>>It means that the crossbow will be present in the inventory. It is using ammo type 3 and it has the lasersight already mounted on it.




TSCR_MAIN_TITLES:0  ;Used with GT_TITLE_SCREEN global trigger.>Detect the main title screen, i.e. the screen where you see "New Game", "Load Game", "Options" and "Exit"

TSCR_NEW_GAME:1   ;Used with GT_TITLE_SCREEN global trigger.>Detect the [New Game] screen, where you can select a specific level name.

TSCR_LOAD_GAME:2   ;Used with GT_TITLE_SCREEN global trigger.>Detect the [Load Game] screen.

FGT_SINGLE_SHOT:$0001  ;This flag set the current global trigger for single execution. When the global trigger will be executed it will be disabled to avoid further executions.

FGT_NOT_TRUE:$0002  ;You can use this flag to invert the global trigger condition. For example if you want have a global trigger engaged when lara is NOT poisoned you can type a GlobalTrigger command script like:>>GlobalTrigger=1, FGT_NOT_TRUE, GT_LARA_POISONED, 0, ....>>Remark: this flag doesn't affect the further Condition Trigger Group. Anyway in trigger group you can find a similar flag to invert the single condition triggers.

FGT_PUSHING_COLLISION:$0004  ;This flag works only when used with global triggers: GT_COLLIDE_ITEM or GT_COLLIDE_SLOT>The engine computes three type of collision:>- Bound Box Collision: this collision is very easy to compute but not very precise. The engine compares two collision box of current frame for both moveables and gives positive esite if the two boxes are overlapped in some 3d space position.>This is the default collision used for global triggers GT_COLLIDE_ITEM or GT_COLLIDE_SLOT.>>- Pushing item collision: This collision works like Bound Box Collision but in this case it's necessary also that an object pushes other object to give a positive esite. Theorically this collision could be considered more precise of common Bound Box Collision.>If you add the FGT_MOVING_COLLISION flag the global trigger will use own this type of "pushing"  collision.>>- Mesh on Mesh collision: this is the more complex and precise computes for collisions: each mesh of first moveable will be compared (using sphere mesh) with each mesh of second moveable to detect a collision. It performed only in very seldom circustances, for example for collision of lara with some traps, like blades and swords.

FGT_DISABLED:$0008  ;By default a global trigger works always, from begin of current level until it is performed with a flag FGT_SINGLE_SHOT to disable it.>Anyway if you want, you can disable your global trigger at start, and then to able it only in a second time using the flipeffect "Enable/Disable the GlobalTrigger...".

FGT_REMOVE_INPUT:$0010 ;Used in GlobalTrigger command.>This flag works only with GT_GAME_KEY1_COMMAND, GT_GAME_KEY2_COMMAND or GT_KEYBOARD_CODE global triggers.>If you add in Flags field the FGT_REMOVE_INPUT flag, when the condition is true, the just received game/keyboard command will be removed and game engine will be not able to detect it.>In this way you can filter or redirect some game command.>The filtering is when you discover when a given game command has been received and you add (with your triggergroup of globaltrigger) some further actions in according with that command.>The redirection is when you want remove fully the effect of that game command and you want replace them with other your effects.

FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED:$0020  ;Used in GlobalTrigger command.>This flag is similar than FGT_SINGLE_SHOT flag, but with a big difference:>>While the FGT_SINGLE_SHOT performs first time the trigger group when the condition is true and then it will be disabled forever, the new FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED will be resumed when the condition results newly false. For this reason the FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED works in the reality like a multi shot flag but avoiding to perform continuosly the trigger group if the condition results true continuosly.>>We could describe the different working mode with this little table:>>Result of Condition  multi-shot (no flag)   FGT_SINGLE_SHOT   FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED         >-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->   FALSE             No-Run Enabled          No-Run Enabled    No-Run Enabled>   TRUE              Run Enabled             Run Enabled       Run Enabled>   TRUE              Run Enabled             No-Run Disabled   No-Run Enabled>   TRUE              Run Enabled             No-Run Disabled   No-Run Enabled>   FALSE             No-Run Enabled          No-Run Disabled   No-Run Enabled>   FALSE             No-Run Enabled          No-Run Disabled   No-Run Enabled>   TRUE              Run Enabled             No-Run Disabled   Run Enabled>   TRUE              Run Enabled             No-Run Disabled   No-Run Enabled>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

FGT_REPLACE_MANAGEMENT:$0040 ;Used in GlobalTrigger command.>This flag says to trng engine to abort the default procedure in tomb engine used to manage the event (the global trigger) you intercepted.>This flag should be used when you wish use you triggergroup (launched by your globaltrigger command) to manage that event and you don't wish tomb engine interferes with your operations.>Currently the only global trigger that uses this flag is GT_SELECTED_INVENTORY_ITEM

FGT_HIDE_IN_DEBUG:$2000  ;Used in GlobalTrigger command.>This flag doesn't change the behavior of the globaltrigger in runtime, but it removes the debugging mexages in debug mode (DGX_LOG_SCRIPT_COMMANDS diagnostic) for this globaltrigger.>The reason to use this flag is when you are studying another script command but this global trigger continues to fill the log with many mexages not intersting for you.

FO_ENABLED:$0001  ;By default the organizer is disabled at start, and you have to call a flipeffect to enable it. If you want this organizer was enabled from start of level you have to add then FO_ENABLED flag.

FO_LOOP:$0002   ;Adding FO_LOOP flag, the list of (time + PerformGroup) will be performed in endless way. After that the last  Performgroup has been performed, the organizer will restart from first performgroup.>Using this flag you can perform some performgroup each "number of seconds">Remember you can use some flipeffects to start or stop an organizer, this feature is useful own when you want perform in loop mode an organizer only for a specific section of game or in some time interval.

FO_TICK_TIME:$0004  ;Change time unit misure. By default, i.e. if you DON'T use this flag, the time is in seconds, but, if you want use a more precise units of time you can add this flag  in "Flags Organizer" field of Organizer, and the time you type will be interpreted like frame ticks, i.e. the minimum time unit.>The tick frame is 1/30 of second so if you mean set also some big time, to convert in seconds just you type the number of seconds * 30.>For example:>15 = half second>300 = 10 seconds

FO_DEMO_ORGANIZER:$0008  ;Used by Organizer command.>This flag changes drammatically the operative mode of current organizer to work in according with the demo.pak whom index you set in Parameter field of Organizer= script command.>>A demo organizer will be used to perform some triggers in precises frame of linked demo.pak while it'is playing (or recording).>The target is to create a cutscene.>>The main differences of demo organizer are:>>- The FO_ENABLED flag, will be ignored. The organiser will be enabled when the demo (whom id has been typed in Paramter field of organizer) has been started. It will be the demo to start byself the organizer and never viceversa.>>- The FO_LOOP flag will be ignored. >>- The FO_TICK_TIME flag will be ignored, anyway a demo organizer works always in tick frames (and never seconds) but the way to type the tick frames is now different (see next paragraph)>>- The "time" field of time/triggergroup pair array, now works not like distance-time from previous trigger, like it happened in common organizer, but now it works as absolute frame from beginning of the demo.>For instance if you have a demo with a length of 100 seconds for 3000 frames, if you wish perform a trigger at first frame and another to last frame you'll type the time/trigger array with following values:>>0, 1, 3000, 2>>Where in above example we'll perform triggergroup 1 at start, and triggergroup 2 at end of the demo.>>Note: remember that you can discover the precise frame in a demo enabling the diagnostic for demo recording with the  >>Diagnostic= ENABLED>DiagnosticType= IGNORE, EDGX_RECORDING_DEMO>>script commands.>And in game, when you play a demo you can put in pause it and read the current frame keeping down the F8 key.>>Remarks: >- If you think to launch a common organizer in same moment you perform a demo the result could be leak, because the demo works also in inventory and all paused menu, changing its itnernal frame counter, while the common organizer are frozen while there is inventory. >Other to this difference, the frame counter used by common organizer is into the draw frame cycle, while that of a demo organizer is into the read-input cycle. In some cirucstances these two cycles have a different frame amount. For above reason you cann't syncronize very fine a common organizser with a demo.>>- Theorically the last valid frame index inside a demo is given to AmountOfFrames - 1, so in above example it should be 2999 and not 3000. Anyway is acceptable also using the total amount of frames. The difference between Amount-1 and Amount is very lite, the frame in game it's the same, but the Amount-1 frame is yet in demo-playing mode, while the Amoun frame index is the first frame after the quitting of current demo. This difference it's meaningful only in the case of condtion triggers working on demo is playing status.

SQ_LOW_QUALITY:11025
SQ_MEDIUM_QUALITY:22050
SQ_HIGH_QUALITY:44100

IMPORT_MEMORY:1      ;Used in ImportFile command.>If you select as ImportType the value IMPORT_MEMORY, the corresponding file will be loaded directly in RAM memory and it will be used only from memory.>The advantage is that the file will be started more fastly since it will be not required a disk access to find and load it in memory. This could be very important for sound files, where, in some circustances, the access from hard disk could create a little slow down in frame rate of the game.>>Instead, speaking about the disadvantages, the most problem is about the usage of RAM memory, and this could be a real problem if you exaggerate to import too much and too big files in IMPORT_MEMORY mode.>For example if you tried to import in memory all audio files of AUDIO folder (from 000.wav to 111.wav) it will be used about 110 Mb of RAM memory only for imported files, then, adding the memory used from TRNG engine and other memory for other level files the risk is to have leak performaneces because Windows will be forced to use virtual memory to do run the game.>It's obvious that this problem changes in according with quantity of RAM memory installed on the current PC, anyway using as medium/low value a PC with 256 MB of RAM, I suggest to limit the total amount of memory imported files to be less than 20 Mb.>>My suggestion is to reduce the usage of memory imported files only when it's strictly necessary, i.e. when you want start very fastly little sound files or images.>>In other circustances it's better avoid the IMPORT_MEMORY, preferring the IMPORT_TEMPORARY import mode.>See description of IMPORT_TEMPORARY value to compare the differences.>Remark: You can import upto 200 files in IMPORT_MEMORY mode.

IMPORT_TEMPORARY:2  ;Used in ImportFile command.>When you import a file in script.dat using this import type (IMPORT_TEMPORARY) the file will be stored in script.dat only in temporary mode and it will be immediatly exported at start of game.>For "exported" we mean that the file will created newly with original name and (further) folder.>For example if you import a file using following ImportFile command:>>ImportFile=1, Help\Start.htm , FTYPE_USERFILE, IMPORT_TEMPORARY>>The content of "Start.htm" file in subfolder "help" of TRLE folder, will be imported in script.dat>When the game will be started (for example in other PC where the sub-folder "Help" and the file "Start.htm" are missing) the TRNG (tomb4) engine will create newly a sub-folder named "help" and it will save the file with name "start.htm">>Pratically the temporary import mode works using the script.dat like a simple "container" where store and then retry files to install in trle folder before the game starts.>About advantage and disadvantages of temporary import, the advantage consist to have a raw installer for your trle folder, removing further problem with special files (like .ogg or images) using level manager, while the disadvantage is that there is not most speed in starting of these imported files, since they will be used in game loading them in common way from hard disk.>Remark: there is no limit about the number or the size of imported files in IMPORT_TEMPORARY mode.

FTYPE_USERFILE:1  ;Used in ImportFile command.>You should use FTYPE_USERFILE type for each file non recognized by TRNG, or simply for each file that will be not used directly by game engine.>For example if you want give to final player of your level some .html files like introduction to your adventure, or .txt files, or image to be used only from player and not from tomb4.exe, then you should use the type FTYPE_USERFILE.>When TRNG engine find an imported file of FTYPE_USERFILE, it will ignore it, and the only operation it will perform on it, it will be to export it saving in correct folder of trle.>Remark: for this reason it's not logical to use the import mode IMPORT_MEMORY for FTYPE_USERFILE files because the player will be not able to see them.

FTYPE_SOUND:2  ;Used in ImportFile command.>You should use FTYPE_SOUND value for all sound files with extensions .wav, .mp3, .ogg, .aiff, .mp2, .mp1 (i.e. all sound files supported from new sound engine implemented in TRNG) that you mean to use in game with the specific flipeffect trigger "Play imported sound with <&>Id ....".

FTYPE_SETTINGS:3 ;Used in ImportFile command.>This type is used from some script commands to have an external binary setting file, when the required settings for that command are too much to be hosted by the usual command arguments.>Note: The FTYPE_SETTINGS type requires always as ImportType the IMPORT_MEMORY setting.



TRB_SELECTIVE_VIEW:$0001  ;Used in Turbo command. TRB_SELECTIVE_VIEW excludes all computes about static objects non visible in game (because back of current camera view).>Theorically just the directx functions perform this cutoff, but looking the source code, it appears that many computes have been performed in spite these statics object are outside of visible world. Hence, this setting allows to save some time otherwise wasted in no useful computes.

TRB_HIGH_PRIORITY:$0002  ;Used in Turbo command. TRB_HIGH_PRIORITY set an higher class priority for whole tomb4 process, to increase the time supplied to tomb4 respect to other processes. Theorically this setting could advantage the game engine when in the PC there are other programs are working, or some background services like antivirus. If in your PC there are no other big process this setting will have no visible effect.

TRB_ASYNC_FRAMES:$0004  ;Used in Turbo command.>From 1.2.2.7 version, this setting works in a different way respect the past.>Now when the game loses some frame, the turbo command perform two or more frames in a shorter time to recover the previously lost frame. The result in this situation is that lara will cover same distance in same time as in full frame rate  but the movements will be not always fluide. In spite this solution is not perfect in some situation is better than the big slowdown you can see when the engine is not able to support the standard 30 frames per second.


TRB_OPTIMIZE_SORTING:$0008  ;Used in Turbo command. TRB_OPTIMIZE_SORTING optimizes the sorting of polygons list used by tomb4 engine before performing many draw operations. >Usually, this optimizing gives a gain of about 5 or 6 fps (frame per second)

TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW:$0010  ;Used in Turbo command. TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW enable a complex compute to adapt the max far view (really the level far view) in current level in according with current performances.>Pratically, when TRNG discovers that it is not able to keep the medium value of 30 FPS (Frame per second), it will reduce progressivly the level far view until it get newly the 30 fps (really you can change the value of frame rate to keep typying a value in FPStoKeep field). When it reaches optimal frame rate and keep this good result for three second, it will try to increase level far view very slowly until to reach the value for levelfarview you set in script.dat file.>This method allows to have a variable distance to show far objects to preserve always good frame rate performances.>Remark: the TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW setting could not work fine togheter with TRB_ASYNC_FRAMES setting, because this last setting creates an irregular response in internal frame rate value and, since TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW uses own the frame rate value to perform the changes in far view, it could be confused by TRB_ASYNC_FRAMES >Remark2: If you mean use TRB_ADAPTIVE_FARVIEW it's advisable don't exagerate about setting of LevelFarView in this level.>Many level builders set LeverFarView=127 only because 127 is the max value but this number is uselessly huge, since it's very seldom you have more than 60 sector visible in direct line to watch. By other hand, setting 127 the adaptive job will be slacked because when it'll happen a bad frame rate the engine will spend much time to decrease far view from 127 sector to really meaningful value like 20 or 30 sectors. Same speech for inverse operation, when the far view has been reduced drammatically, not just the frame rate will go on newly the engine will spend many time to increase newly the far view until 127 sector.>For this reason I suggest as ideal values for adaptive farview to set LevelFarView = (about) 60 while the required fps to keep set (about) to 24 fps.


DIR_NORTH:0  ;Absolute moving to north. 
DIR_EAST:1 ;Absolute moving to east. 
DIR_SOUTH:2  ;Absolute moving to south.
DIR_WEST:3  ;absolute moving to west

DIR_UP:$10  ;Absolute moving up
DIR_DOWN:$11  ;absolute moving down

DIR_FORWARD:$12 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction.>This flag will move the item forward respect its current facing. For instance if the item is looking to north the item will move to north but this is true for any intermediate direction.

DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90:$13 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction with turning.>Setting this flag the item will move forward but its facing will be changed smootly until to be turned by 90 degrees respect its forward movement. With this setting you can move an item to do circumvent a corner of 90 degress that is at his left.>You can set in Extra field the turning speed typing a value that will be added for each frame to current item facing.>The units work in this way:>45 degrees = $2000 >90 degrees = $4000>You can set any intermediate value, of course and, by other hand, it's better setting little values since the value you typed in Extra field will be added to current facing 30 times for second. Reasonable values are in the range 32 / 1024>>Note: set only positive values, please. The direction of turning will be set by the given DIR_ value direction. When you set a left turning the turning speed (you typed) it will be subtracted to current facing of item, but you have to type only positive values.


DIR_TURNING_LEFT_45:$14  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction with turning.>This flag works like DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90 flag but in this case the turning will be only by 45 degrees.>See description of DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90 flag for more infos.

DIR_LU_TURNING_180:$15 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction with turning.>This flag will move forward the item but changing continuosly its facing, turning at left, until it will have the opposite facing of start.>See description of DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90 about customization of turning speed.

DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_45:$16 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction with turning.>This flag move forward the item changing its facing until to turn it by 45 degrees respect its orginal facing.>See description of DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90 about customization of turning speed.

DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_90:$17  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction with turning.>This flag move forward the item changing its facing until to turn it by 90 degrees respect its orginal facing.>See description of DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90 about customization of turning speed.

DIR_RU_TURNING_180:$18 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Relative direction with turning.>This flag will move forward the item but changing continuosly its facing, turning at right, until it will have the opposite facing of start.>See description of DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90 about customization of turning speed.

DIR_LARA_FACING:$19 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>The direction will be the same where lara is looking.>This direction could be useful when lara throw away an item (or bullet) in front of her.

DIR_LEADING_ACTOR_FACING:$1A  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This direction will be the same where the leading actor is looking. This maybe useful when the leading actor throw this item in front of him.>Note: remember you can set an enemy as leading actor with the Action 87.

DIR_DIRECTION_LARA_LEADING_ACTOR:$1B ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>The direction will be the line from lara versus the leading actor.>Please try to understand that this is different than DIR_LARA_FACING since in the case of DIR_DIRECTION_LARA_LEADING_ACTOR flag has no importance where lara is looking but lara and the leading actor will be used as two points where draw the direction.>Note: remember you can always add the DIR_INVERT_DIRECTION flag to have the opposite direction, and in this case, the direction from leading actor to lara.

DIR_HEAD_FOR_LARA:$01C  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This direction is given from the current position of item to be moved and the position of lara as ending position.

DIR_HEAD_FOR_LEADING_ACTOR:$1D  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Direction from current position of item to move and the position of leading actor.

DIR_HEAD_FOR_EXTRA_ACTOR:$1E  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Direction from current position of item to move and the position of extra actor

DIR_INVERT_DIRECTION:$0100  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This is a flag that you add to any DIR_ direction value.>When you add this flag a relative direction with turning, you the same kind of turning but with opposite forward movememnt.>For instance the pair:>DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_90+DIR_INVERT_DIRECTION  >it will move the item backward, turning at its right.




FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP:$0001  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>Adding this flag the movement will be endless and for this reason you'll have to use some flipeffect trigger to stop it (see F177, F178, F179 triggers)>>For most directions (DIR_ values) the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag will invert the direction once it has been covered the given distance (typed in Distance field), anyway with some particular DIR_ values, this flag will work in a different way:>>With all turning directions (DIR_TURNING_LEFT_90, DIR_TURNING_LEFT_45, DIR_LU_TURNING_180, DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_45, DIR_TURNING_RIGHT_90, DIR_RU_TURNING_180) the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag, it will do continue the same movement with new turnings every linees of distance length. Using different values for turning speed, horizontal speed and distance, you can get that an item drew a circle, an elipse, a rectangle or a square, changing its facing in according with current direction.>>With al "head_for" directions (DIR_HEAD_FOR_LARA, DIR_HEAD_FOR_LEADING_ACTOR, DIR_HEAD_FOR_EXTRA_ACTOR) the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag it will continue to follow the given target (Lara, Leading actor or extra actor), updating the direction everytime it had completed the given distance. For instance, mixing the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag with DIR_HEAD_FOR_LARA direction, you get a sort of little robot that will follow lara in any her movement, loosing the contact with her only in the linee of distance length, moving newly head for lara at end of that distance gap.>>For all other directions, the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag, will invert direction at end of covered distance.>>Note: with all movement having a non constant speed or gravity simulation, the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag will keep the max reached speed o downward gravity with no new acceleration at beginning of new cycle. The only expection is for FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY flag, that will repeat the moving up-down gravity endless, getting the idea of a frog that will continue to jump.


FMOV_HEAVY_AT_END:$0002 ;Enable further heavy trigger in final sector of the path.

FMOV_TRIGGERS_ALL:$0004 ;Enable all common triggers that item meets in its path. The "common" triggers are the triggers enabled by Lara. You can use this flag to do work this item like the Mechanical Scarab to enable some trap.

FMOV_HEAVY_ALL:$0008 ;Enable all heavy triggers that item meets in its path. You can use this feature to create a chain of events in game.

FMOV_USE_LEADING_ACTOR_INDEX:$0010 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>With this flag you replace the given value in IndexItem field with the index of current enemy set as leading actor.>This is an interesting way to use over and over the same parameter=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM to do move different enemies. Just you set as leading actor a different enemy and you can use again the same PARAM_MOVE_ITEM to move also this new enemy.

FMOV_USE_EXTRA_ACTOR_INDEX:$0020  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>With this flag you replace the given value in IndexItem field with the index of current enemy set as extra actor.>This is an interesting way to use over and over the same parameter=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM to do move different enemies. Just you set as extra actor a different enemy and you can use again the same PARAM_MOVE_ITEM to move also this new enemy.

FMOV_IGNORE_FLOOR_COLLISION:$0040  ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>When the movement affects a new direction or speed or gravity mode (new management from 1.2.2.7 version), by default the engine will forbid to the item to "sink" in the floor. >This means that when you set a UP/DOWN direction or a gravity mode that move downward the item, when it will reaches the floor it will be stopped.>>Also with horizontal movement, if the item reaches a point of floor that is higher of its position, the engine will move upward the item to stand over the floor.>Anyway if you wish that the item was able to sink in the floor you can add the FMOV_IGNORE_FLOOR_COLLISION flag and the engine will not perform any control about floor collision.

FMOV_WAIT_STAND_ON_FLOOR:$0080 ;Used in Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>By default, the moving will be completed when the distance supplied in Distance field has been reached.>Anyway, when you set some kind of gravity, and once covered the distance the item is yet above floor, falling down, the stop of moving affects a weird effect: the item will stop in the empty, at some height from the floor.>If you wish avoid this situation you can add the FMOV_WAIT_STAND_ON_FLOOR flag, and the movement will be stopped only when, other that the distance has been covered, the item has reached the floor, falling down.


FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY:$0100 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag will be move upward the item and then it will fall down, like a jump of a frog. The shape of the jump should be regular, i.e. the ascendent (beginning) part, will have the inverse shape in descendent final part.>>Note: you can type a percentage variation of vertical speed in the Speed field using following formula:>>PercentageOfChangeVerticalSpeed * 256 + HorizontalSpeed>>Remember that you can not type a value higher than 255.>>The value of PercentageOfChangeVerticalSpeed  work around the 100 value, that should be "no change".>If you wish double the vertical speed, use 200, while if wish the half of preset vertical speed, you'll use 50.

FMOV_LEAF_GRAVITY:$0200  ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>When the item is far from the floor, it will move down very slowly with no accelerations, like a light leaf moving slowly down.>Note: the only collision checked is for floor, not for other items or walls or ceiling.>Note: you can change the preset vertical speed typing a percentage of variation in Speed field. See the description of FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY to know how compute the formula to type in that field.

FMOV_EXPLOSION_GRAVITY:$0300 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag will move the item upper at start with the highest speed, and then it will decrease fastly.>You can change the max begin speed using percentage of variation in Speed field. See the description of FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY to know how compute the formula to type in that field.

FMOV_APPLE_GRAVITY:$0400 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This is most common gravity. Begin slowly and increase fastly until to reach a middle vertical speed downward, and then increase only slowly this middle value. Like an apple falling from the tree.>You can change the middle value of vertical speed with a percentage of variation to type in Speed field.>See the description of FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY to know how compute the formula to type in that field.

FMOV_APOLLO_GRAVITY:$0500 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag move up the item with a slow vertical speed for a short time, than it will reach the max speed and it remain to max speed always upward.>You can change the max vertical speed with a percentage of variation to type in Speed field.>See the description of FMOV_FROG_JUMP_GRAVITY to know how compute the formula to type in that field.

FMOV_MAN_GRAVITY:$0600 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag will move down the item when it's above the floor.>The vertical speed will be about that a big man falling in the empty.

FMOV_ANVIL_GRAVITY:$0700 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag enable the max level of (downstairs) gravity.>The "anvil" name has been chosen as symbol of very very heavy item, in this logical you should think to anvil like it had a heavier weight than man (in spite it is not true, probably).


FMOV_EXPLOSION_SPEED:$1000 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag will give to the item a speed beginning from max value and decreasing enough slowly (remaining therefor on high values) in the progress.>This happen when an explosion throws awyay all items closed to it.>Note: warning there is no check about collisions. The item will stop its race only when it reaches the distance you set in Distance field.>The value you type in Speed field will be used as percentage to change the preset speed of this explosion movement.>If you type 100, no change will be performed. 200 will double the speed (unsuggested, increase this speed), 50 will reduce by half the preset speed. Ect.
 
FMOV_MAGNET_SPEED:$2000  ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag will set a non costant horizontal speed for the item.>The item will begin slowly to increase its speed, until to increase alwayws faster this speed. Like an item attracted from a (far) source.>The value you type in Speed field will be used as percentage to change the preset speed of this effect.>If you type 100, no change will be performed. 200 will double the speed, 50 will reduce by half the preset speed. Ect.

FMOV_CAR_SPEED:$3000 ;used in Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM script command>This flag will move the item, beginning from a slow speed that will be increased gradually, until to reach a max speed that will remain constant.>The value you type in Speed field will be used as percentage to change the preset speed of this effect.>If you type 100, no change will be performed. 200 will double the speed, 50 will reduce by half the preset speed. Ect.


PARAM_MOVE_ITEM:2  ;Used as first value in Parameters script command. You can set the values used to move a moveable or a static using the specific "Move."  flipeffect.>>Syntax: Paramaters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM, IdParamList, Flags (FMOV_...), IndexItem, Direction (DIR_...), Distance, Speed, MovingSound, FinalSound, Extra>>Note: from 1.2.2.7 version it has been added a new set of DIR_ values and FMOV_ flags. The main target of these improvement was to add non constant speed and gravity simulation to movements.>The old DIR_ values and FMOV_ flags should work as in the past, anyway the FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag has different operative modes in accoding with DIR_ values, now. So read the new description of FMOV_INFINITE_LOOP flag for more infos.>With 1.2.2.7 version has been added a new field named "Extra" at end of other old fields.>>Field descriptions:>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_MOVE_ITEM" command script in trigger window of ngle. >You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_MOVE_ITEM command, 2 for second ect.>>Flags (FMOV_...) field>---------------------->You can set one or more FMOV_ values linked with + (plus) sign>See description in Reference panel to get description of different FMOV_ flags.>Remark: you can type IGNORE in this field if you don't wish use any flag.>>IndexItem field>--------------->This is the index you can read in yellow frame when you click over some item in NGLE program.>Remark: you can use static or moveable anyway you have to use the correct flipeffect in according with static or moveable nature of item.>About static remember the static are owned from its room and for this reason you should avoid to move a static other to bounds of its room. >>Direction (DIR_...) field>------------------------->You have to choose one DIR_ constant to set the direction of moving.>See the DIR_ list in reference panel of NGCenter program, you find it in _MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section.>>Note: from 1.2.2.7 version it has been added some FMOV_ constants to simulate different kinds of gravity. It's not suggested mixing the DIR_UP or DIR_DOWN direction with a FMOV_ flag for gravity because the result will be the overlapping of two different computation on same Y coordinate. If you are non satisfacted by this mixing and you wish only have a DIR_DOWN for the falling of an item, there are two possible solutions:>>- Use the DIR_DOWN direction but setting 0 as Speed field. In this way it will be only the gravity you choose to affect the movement of the item.>- Use some horizontal direction (east, west, north, south or forward) but with a very short Distance field. In this way the item, ohter to fall down for the gravity you chose, it will move a bit in the direction you chose. In this case remember to set also the FMOV_WAIT_STAND_ON_FLOOR flag to force the movement will be completed only when the item reached the floor.>>>Distance field>-------------->In this field you set the distance of moving. The used units have as reference 1 sector = 1024, hence, 512 is half-sector, 256 is a click ect.>I suggest to use always multiple of 256 (one click) to avoid troubles.>The max value you can type for distance is 64512, corresponding to 63 sectors.>>Speed field>----------->The speed value is the number of units that will be added to current position to move the item.>The used units are the same of Distance field: 1 click = 256 units.>Remember that this speed will be added 30 times for second, so it's better don't exagerate to set big values as speed. A reasonable speed is enclosed in the range  from 8  to 64.>Remark: It's advisable set as speed a value that is a perfect multiple of distance, otherwise there will be a bit error in compute of final distance.>>Note: From 1.2.2.7 version in the higher byte of Speed field you can set an extra value that to change the preset values for gravity when you added a FMOV_ flag for gravity.>The compute to type two values in same field is given by following formula:>>ChangeVSpeed * 256 + Speed>>The changeVSpeed is percentage value to increase or decrease the value of gravity. If you use 100 the gravity will be the same of preset values for that kind of gravity. If you set 50 the speed will be the half, while if you type 200 the gravity will be doubled.>In the case you do not set any value as ChangeVSpeed (i.e 0*256 +Speed), trng will see the zero value as IGNORE and therefor like it was 100 (no changes about gravity)>>Moving sound field>------------------>Optional. If you wish it went played a sound effect in looped mode while the item is moving type here a number of sound effect.>You find the list of sound effect in reference panel of NG Center, in the section named "SOUND SFX indices list">Remark: if you don't wish any sound type IGNORE in this field.>>Final sound field>----------------->Optional. If you wish it went played a sound effect when the item reaches the final position, type here a number of sound effect.>You find the list of sound effect in reference panel of NG Center, in the section named "SOUND SFX indices list">Remark: if you don't wish any sound type IGNORE in this field.>>Extra field>----------->This field has been added from 1.2.2.7 version and it is a general purpose parameter.>See description of FMOV_ flags and DIR_ values to discover how to use the Extra field.


PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM:3  ;Used as first value in Parameters script command. It baptizes a parameters list as data for rotating of items, moveables or statics.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM, IdParamList, FlagsRotation (FROT_), ItemIndex, DirHRotation (ROTH_...), HRotationAngle, SpeedHRotation, DirVRotation (ROTV_..), VRotationAngle, SpeedVRotation, MovingSound, FinalSound>>Description of fields:>----------------------->>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_ROTATE_ITEM command, 2 for second ect>You have number between 1 and 99.>>FlagsRotation (FROT_) field>--------------------------->You can type one or more FROT_ constants linked with + (plus) sign.>See description of FROT_ constants in Reference panel of NG Center.>>ItemIndex field>--------------->This is the index of item to rotate, you can read it in yellow frame that appears when you click over some item in NGLE program.>You can choose moveable or static but remember to perform the correct flipeffect in according with nature (static or moveable) of item.>>DirHRotation (ROTH_...) field>------------------------------>If you wish have an horizontal rotation you'll type in this field a ROTH_ value to set the direction of rotation (clockwise or opposite)>>HRotationAngle field>-------------------->In this field you set the wished horizontal angle rotation.>The unit of measurement for this field is a bit weird but it that used in tomb4 engine.>These are some references:>$2000  = 45 degrees>$4000  = 90 degrees>$8000 = 180 degrees>>For example if you want that some object rotates by 90 degrees you'll have to type in this field the value $4000 (or in decimal: 16384)>>Remarks: If you set the FROT_ flag for endless rotation the VRorationAngle field will be ignored, since the item will round continuosly.>>SpeedHRotation field>-------------------->The speed is a value that will be added to current orientation factor.>The unit of measurement is the same of horizontal or vertical RotationAngle, but in this field you'll have to type value very littler than final angle to reach, of course.>>Remember that the value you type like speed will be added to current orienting 30 times for second.>>Remark: It's advisable to use as speed values multiple of power by 2. Typying in hexadecimal is easy to remember the good speeds: >$80 , $100 , $180, $200, $280, $300  ect>If you don't use these values there is the risk that the speed value was NOT a multiple of final Rotation Angle and hence the object could be not exaclty positioned in final position.>To discover if value for RotationAngle and Speed are good, just dividing Rotation by Speed, if you get a result with decimal point the couple of values is wrong.>  >>DirVRotation (ROTV_..) field>---------------------------->If you wish have a vertical rotation you'll type in this field a ROTV_ value to set the direction of rotation (forward or backward)>Remark: unfortunately for statics it's not foreseen a vertical rotation, so you can apply a vertical rotation only to moveable items.>>VRotationAngle field>-------------------->In this field you set the wished vertical angle rotation.>The unit of measurement for this field is a bit weird but it that used in tomb4 engine.>These are some references:>$2000  = 45 degrees>$4000  = 90 degrees>$8000 = 180 degrees>>For example if you want that some object rotates by 90 degrees you'll have to type in this field the value $4000 (or in decimal: 16384)>>Remarks: If you set the FROT_ flag for endless rotation the VRorationAngle field will be ignored, since the item will round continuosly.>>SpeedVRotation field>-------------------->This field hosts the speed of vertical rotation.>About the values to set see the description of SpeedHRotation field. The speech is the same, but in this case the rotation is vertical.>>MovingSound field>----------------->Optional field. If you wish assign a sound to item while it is rotating, type a number of sound sfx.>Set IGNORE if you don't wish any sound for moving.>>FinalSound field>---------------->Optional field. If you wish perform a sound when the rotation is complete you can type a sound sfx sound in this field >Set IGNORE if you don't wish any sound for final position.

PARAM_COLOR_ITEM:4  ;Used as first value in Parameters script command. It baptizes a parameters list as data used from trigger to change color of some item.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_COLOR_ITEM, IdParamList, ColorType (COLTYPE_...), ItemIndex, Index1ColorRGB, Index2ColorRGB, SpeedChange>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_COLOR_ITEM" command script in trigger window of ngle.>>ColorType (COLTYPE_...) field>----------------------------->You can choose a COLTYPE_ constant to set the work mode of this PARAM_COLOR_ITEM.>Read the description of COLTYPE_... constants in Reference list of NG Center.>Remark: you can choose only a single COLTYPE_ value, you cann't add two or more values.>>ItemIndex field>--------------->The index of static or moveable for what you want change the color.>You find this value in yellow box in NGLE when you click over some item.>>Index1ColorRGB field>-------------------->Type the IdColor of some ColorRGB= with the rgb value used as first color.>The ColorRGB= have to be in same [Level] section where you place the Parameters=PARAM_COLOR_ITEM command.>>Index2ColorRGB field>-------------------->If your COLTYPE_ requires two colors, you have to type the IdColor of some ColorRGB= command.>>SpeedChange field>----------------->If you use a COLTYPE_ requiring some dynamic effect (like PULSE or SHADE) you can type in SpeedChange field the number of frame for each cycle.>Rememeber that 30 frame = 1 second. So if you want the pulse, from dark color to light color required two seconds you could type 60.>Remark: the valid range for speed is min: 1 max=255 (about 8 seconds)

PARAM_PRINT_TEXT:5  ;Used to store all informations used to print text.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_PRINT_TEXT, IdPrintText, Color (CL_...), FontType (FT_...), BlinkTime, DurateTime, X_Position, Y_Position>>This parameter list will be required by new flipeffect trigger "Text. Print formatted ... string">>IdPrintText field>----------------->This is the number you have to choose in Set Trigger Window with "print formatted text" trigger.>>Color (CL_...) field>-------------------->The color of this text.>See the values CL_... in Reference panel.>>FontType (FT_...) field>----------------------->In this field you can set two or more FT_... constants to describe the size or the preassigned position for text.>Remark: if you wish you can omit the FT_ value to set position and instead you can set the position in pixel coordinates typing two valid values in fields: X_Position and Y_Position. See description of these fields.>>BlinkTime field>--------------->Numeric value to signal interval for blinking when you set also flag FT_BLINK_CHARS in FontType field>Note: for blink time you can use only power by 2 values, like: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 >>DurateTime field>---------------->Number of seconds to show the text on screen.>If you want set as time "forever" type -1 or IGNORE in this field.>Remarks: >(1) If you set forever (IGNORE) for durate, then you can remove the string from screen using flipeffect "Text. Print. Remove (&)Extra NG String from screen">(2) If you use this parameter data for vertical or horizontal scrolling text, the value you type in DurateTime field will be interpreted by trng as the speed value used for scrolling text.>The values for scrolling speed are the following:>>0: Abs. Normal Speed  (30 fps)>1: Abs. Slow Speed (15 fps)>2: Abs. Very Slow Speed (10 fps)>3: Abs. Fast Speed (60 fps)>4: Abs. Very Fast Speed (90 fps)>5: Prop. Normal Speed  (30 fps)>6: Prop. Slow Speed (15 fps)>7: Prop. Very Slow Speed (10 fps)>8: Prop. Fast Speed (60 fps)>9: Prop. Very Fast Speed (90 fps)>>If you set IGNORE in this field (used by scrolling text) the default value used will be 0 i.e. >"Abs. Normal Speed  (30 fps)">>>X_Position and Y_Position fields>-------------------------------->If you set two valid values in these two fields the further FT_ value to set the position will be ignored.>Differently, if you want use some FT_ prefixed position you should type in X_Position and Y_Position fields the values IGNORE for both.>The values you type in these fields are in pixels, anyway, since you cann't to known in advance what it will be the resolution in game (each player could set a different resolution) you should set your coordinates like if screen was always in 1024x768 pixels resolution, then, if the game will have a different resolution the TRNG engine will change the position proportionally in according with the real resolution.>For example if you set Y_Position the value 384 (i.e. 768 / 2) the text will be showd in vertical half position of screen in each screen resolution thanks to trng adapting.>Remark: The Y_Position is not the top pixel of character but the baseline character. This means that if for example you use as Y_Position the value 0 the chracter will be not visible except a little bottom side.

PARAM_SET_CAMERA:6  ;Use to store information in Parameters command to use with FlipEffect to change temporary the camera mode.>>Syntax: Paramaters=PARAM_SET_CAMERA, IdSetCamera, Flags (FSCAM_... ), DistanceCam, VOrientCam, HOrientCam, SpeedCamera>>IdSetCamera field>------------------>This is an univocal identifier to locate these parameters in your [Level] section using this value in flipeffect trigger to set temporary a new camera mode.>>Flags (FSCAM_... ) field>------------------------>In this field you can type one or more FSCAM_.. flags to affect the behavior of this command.>>You can type IGNORE if you don't wish any flag.>>DistanceCam field>----------------->This is the distance of camera from lara.>A reasonable value could be +1600>>For more infos about the concept of "cam distance" see the description of CUST_CAMERA>>If you don't want change this value you can type ignore, and it will be used the standard distance value set for "chase" (follow-me) camera.>>VOrientCam field>---------------->Degrees difference of camera computed on horizonal line (parallel to floor) between camera and Lara.>See the CUST_CAMERA description to read more infos about Vertical Orientation field.>>If you wish you can type IGNORE in this field and the engine will use the standard VOrientCam value set for "chase" camera.>>HOrientCam field>---------------->Set the horizontal oriantation (facing) of camera respect to lara.>>See the CUST_CAMERA description to read more infos about Horizontal Orientation field.>>If you type IGNORE in this field the engine will use the HOrient value set for "chase" camera.>>SpeedCamera field>----------------->This value set the speed of camera to pass from previous camera mode (and position) to current new postion.>The speed works in opposite way: big values = slow movements, little values = fast movementes.>>If you type little values the camera will reach fastly the new position but the movement could be move jerkily and it's not good to see.>If you type a big value the camera will have a more soft movement but to reach the wished position will require more time.>>A reasonable value for fast moving is 1, while for slow movement is 10.>>If you type IGNORE in this field the engine will use the default speed value (10).


PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS:7 ;Used in Parameters= command to store big numbers to use in some flipeffects.>>Syntax: Paramaters=PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS, Many Numbers separeted by commas>>Since for technical reasons it's not possibile type in trigger type window number greather than 255, you can use this script command with PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS value to store big numbers to use in some flipeffects or actions.>The trigger allows to use these big number have a description like this:>>Value in 0 index in Paramaters=PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS script command>Value in 1 index in Paramaters=PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS script command>Value in 2 index in Paramaters=PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS script command>>Ect.>>So if you need to use in this trigger the value 23430 you can type this script command:>>Paramaters=PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS, 23430>>And in trigger windows you select the index =0 of PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS command.>You can store upto 254 number in same PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS command, then you can choose a number with its index, where the first number has index=0, the second = 1`, the third = 2 ect.>>Remark: you cann't type number bigger than 65536 or $FFFF. All numbers will be always used as positive values.

PARAM_SCALE_ITEM:8  ;Used in Parameters= command to store data for scaling effects>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_SCALE_ITEM, IdScaling, ItemIndex, Flags Scaling (FSCA_...), BeginSizePercentage, FinalSizePercentage, PercentageSpeed>>IdScaling field>--------------->Used to locate this specific command in the script.>When you'll use this data you'll have to choose this number in Set Trigger Type window to choose the Parameters with scaling data to use in your trigger.>>ItemIndex field>--------------->In this field you type the index of item to resize. You get this univocal index within NGLE program, performing a right mouse click on the item placed in the map. You read the index in the yellow frame in the rounded parenthesis.>>Flags Scaling (FSCA_...) field>------------------------------->Flag to customize the scaling effect.>You can type IGNORE if you don't use any flag.>Read the FSCFA_... values in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section of Reference Panel of NG_Center program to know the different flags you could use.>>BeginSizePercentage and FinalSizePercentage fields>-------------------------------------------------->The dynamic scaling effect works changing dynamically the size of an item  from a size to another.>The BeginSizePercentage is the beginning size of the item in the game, while the FinalSizePercentage will be the ending size of the item to complete the effect.>The values are in percentage, where 100 = the original (in the wad file) size of the item.>For example if you wish increase the size of this item from original size to the double, you'll use:>BeginSizePercentage=100>and>FinalSizePercentage=200>>Remark: You can type IGNORE in the BeginSizePercentage field only when you use this script command to resize immediatly an item to the wished new size (of FinalSizePercentage field) with no dynamic effect.>>PercentageSpeed field>--------------------->In this field you the value  to add (or subtract) at each frame to BeginSizePercentage to reach the FinalSizePercentage value.>Bigger it will be this value and most fast will be the dynamic resize effect.>>Important: the value is not given in 100th but in 1000th, i.e. one unit = 1/1000. The reason is that in this way you can set also a very slow speed, while, differently, using effective percentage, you could have only like min speed "1/100" and in this way the min speed of the effect could be too fast. 

PARAM_SHOW_SPRITE:9  ;Used with Parameters command to store data to show sprite on screen with flipeffect show sprite.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_SHOW_SPRITE, IdParamShowSprite, Flags Show Sprites (FSS_...), OriginX, OriginY, Width, Height, SlotSprite, SpriteIndex, IdColorRGB, GridX, GridY, Extra Value>>IdParamShowSprite field>----------------------->Here type a progressive number to distinguish this "Parameters=PARAM_SHOW_SPRITE" command from others in same level section.>You'll use the number in this field to signal to flipeffect trigger where looking for sprite show data.>>Flags Show Sprites (FSS_...) field>---------------------------------->You can type in this field FSS_.. constant values to customize the feature of your showing sprite operation.>Read the description of FSS_ constants in Reference panel of NG_Center program for more infos.>>OriginX and OriginY fields>-------------------------->In these two field you should type the origin of (top-left corner) the sprite.>Both values are in micro units, so you can use the [Get Screen Frames] tool you find in [Tools] panel of NG_Center program.>>Width and Height fields>----------------------->You have to set the size that the sprite will have on the game screen.>Like for the OriginX, OriginY fields, you have to type these values in microunits, hence you should use the [Get Screen Frames] tool to choose a rectangle on the screen and then copy both four values in microunits in the OriginX, OriginY, Width and Height fields.>>Remark: if you wish use a sprite grid (with the FSS_SHOW_SPRITE_GRID flag) please, don't confuse, you have to choose like witdh and height the size of a single sprite and not the final size of the sprite grid.>>SlotSprite field>---------------->You should type the sprite slot with the sprite you wish use.>For example you could type DEFAULT_SPRITES, MISC_SPRITES or other slot contain sprites.>>SpriteIndex field>----------------->Here you type the index of the sprite to use within the SlotSprite given.>>Remark: the first sprite has an index = 0>>IdColorRGB field>---------------->You can type in this field the Id number of a previous ColorRbg= script command to add color to the sprite.>>Remark: the add color feature works only when you enable the transparent feature for the sprite adding the FSS_TRANSPARENT flag. while with the full opaque sprites the IdColorRbg will be ignored.>>GridX and GridY fields>---------------------->These fields are used only with FSS_SHOW_SPRITE_GRID flag.>For example if you wish show an image created with 2x1 sprites, you should type 2 in Gridx and 1 in GridY>See description of FSS_SHOW_SPRITE_GRID flag for more infos.>If you don't use FSS_SHOW_SPRITE_GRID flag the gridx, gridy flags will be ignored.>>>Extra Value field>------------------>This field could be used in according with some FSS_ flag. >See the descriptions of the FSS flags to discover when this field is really used.

PARAM_TRIANGLE:10 ;Used to store the three vertices to define a triangle to use as fragmented trigger.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_TRIANGLE, IdParamList, Xa, Ya, Xb, Yb, Xc, Yc>>You define a triangle with three 2D vertices.>Each vertex is a point of a game square of 1024x1024 units.>The origin is the top-left corner (north-west corner in planar view in NGLE program)>The X axis moves from 0 (West side of the square) to 1023 (East side of the square)>The Y axis moves from 0 (North side of the square) to 1023 (South side of the square)>>IdParamList field>----------------->You define an univocal id number, different than others Parameters=PARAM_TRIANGLE in same [Level] section.>You'll use this number to use these data with the fragmented trigger for custom triangles>>Xa, Ya fields>------------->Define the A(x,y) vertex>>Xb, Yb fields>------------->Define the B(x,y) vertex>>Xc, Yc fields>------------->Define the C(x,y) vertex>>Example: >to define a triangle corresponding to a north-east corner triangle with 512 of size, you should use following command>>Parameters=PARAM_TRIANGLE, IdParamList, 512, 0, 1023, 0, 1023, 512>>Remarks:>Using the custom triangles, and exporting the condition triggers that use them, in a conditional trigger group, you can cover pratically any shape for your trigger.>If you wish create a detailed shape, you can add different triangles, just you use the TGROUP_OR flag in the TriggerGroup command, to link the different triangle triggers.>If you wish you can mix triangles with other shapes, like circle or grid triggers, linked with the (default) TGROUP_AND, to have like triggerable zone only those points where all fragmented triggers are true in same moment.


PARAM_QUADRILATERAL:11 ;Used to store the four vertices to define a quadrilateral to use as fragmented trigger.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_QUADRILATERAL, IdParamList, Xa, Ya, Xb, Yb, Xc, Yc, Xd, Yd>>A quadrilateral could be a rectangle, a square but also a trapezium or a rhombus.>If it has four sides it is a quadrilateral.>>It's not important what is the first point you use as A(x,y) vertex, but it's necessary you type the vertices following the perimeter in clockwise order.>>You define a quadrilateral with four 2D vertices.>Each vertex is a point of a game square of 1024x1024 units.>The origin is the top-left corner (north-west corner in planar view in NGLE program)>The X axis moves from 0 (West side of the square) to 1023 (East side of the square)>The Y axis moves from 0 (North side of the square) to 1023 (South side of the square)>>IdParamList field>----------------->You define an univocal id number, different than others Parameters=PARAM_QUADRILATERAL in same [Level] section.>You'll use this number to use these data with the fragmented trigger for quadrilateral>>Xa, Ya fields>------------->Define the A(x,y) vertex>>Xb, Yb fields>------------->Define the B(x,y) vertex>>Xc, Yc fields>------------->Define the C(x,y) vertex>>Xd, Yd fields>------------->Define the D(x,y) vertex

PARAM_CIRCLE:12 ;Used to store the circle data to use with a fragmented triger>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_CIRCLE, IdParamList, xCenter, yCenter, Radius>>>IdParamList field>----------------->You define an univocal id number, different than others Parameters=PARAM_CIRCLE in same [Level] section.>>xCenter and yCenter field>------------------------->In these two fields you type the center of our circle. Remember that the origin of current squared game sector is (0,0) and it is in top-left corner.>The coordinate of the game square go from 0 to 1023.>The X axis is in NGLE view the west-east direction, while the Y axis go from North to South.>>Tips & Tricks: you can place the center also outside of current game sector but the effect will work only inside of current game square.>A reason to place the center outside it could be when you wish having only a very light bend. In this case, if you wish, for example, having a light bending in south-side of current sector you could set the center of the circle in the sector at south of current sector, so let say, at (512, 1600). Then, to have some zone in our sector we'll set a big radius like radius = 800>>Note: you can use also negative numbers for the center, and it will be necessary when you wish place the center outside and in a sector at west or at north of current game square.>>Radius field>------------>The radius use game units, too. So a circle centered in current square sector, to cover all side will have a 512 value as radius.

PARAM_LIGHTNING:13 ;Used to store data to shot a lightning>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_LIGHTNING, IdParamList, Lightning flags (LGTN_...), SourcePosItem, TargetPosItem, IdColorRGB, Intensity, SoundEffect, Size, ParticleDurate, IntervalTime, Alfa, Beta>>IdParamList field>----------------->You define an univocal id number, different than others Parameters=PARAM_LIGHTNING in same [Level] section. >Then you'll use this id to pass to the trigger to set current parameters.>>Lightning flags (LGTN_...) field>--------------------------------->You can type one or more LGTN_ flags to customize the lightning effect.>If you wish you can type IGNORE in this field to se no flag.>See the meaning of LGTN_ flags in the Reference panel of NG_Center program, in the MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section.>>SourcePosItem field>------------------->To set a position you have to supply an item and trng will use the position of that item for the source position.>In this field you can also type IGNORE and in this case trng will use a random position in the sky (above the target position) as source position.>>If you wish set a precise source position, you can type in this field:>>A moveable index  + the OTYPE_MOVEABLE flag (note: in the reality you can omit it, because missing other OTYPE_ flags, the moveable type will be used)>>A null mesh item OCB value (the null mesh items are like the AI_ objects or the LARA_START_POS item) + the OTYPE_AI_DATA flag>REMARK: Read carefully above row: if you wish use a LARA_START_POS, you have to type its OCB value and NOT the index.>This means you should set in that null mesh object an OCB value different than any other in your level.>>A static object index + the OTYPE_STATIC flag>>>TargetPosItem field>------------------->To set a position you have to supply an item and trng will use that position of that item as the target position.>>You can type in this field:>>A moveable index  + the OTYPE_MOVEABLE flag (note: in the reality you can omit the flag, because missing other OTYPE_ flags, the moveable type will be used as default)>>A null mesh item OCB value (the null mesh items are like the AI_ objects or the LARA_START_POS item) + the OTYPE_AI_DATA flag>>REMARK: Read carefully above row: if you wish use a LARA_START_POS, you have to type its OCB value and NOT the index.>This means you should set in that null mesh object an OCB value different than any other in your level.>A trick, to keep different ocb values for whole level, is to compute the ocb value, multiplying the room nummber by 10 and then use this as first ocb value for items in that room.>>A static object index + the OTYPE_STATIC flag>>You can type also IGNORE in this field and in this case you'll have a random (far) lightning.>You should use IGNORE in TargetPosItem field, when lara is in a wide outside landscape.>With IGNORE as target, in fact, the trng engine will choose a random target placed very far from Lara from 8 to 20 sectors, choosing the side where lara is able to see it.>>>IdColorRGB field>---------------->You type here the ID of an (previously typed) ColorRBG= command where you stored the color you wish use for the lightning.>If you type IGNORE in this field it will be used the white color.>>Intensity field>--------------->You can type values that werea (about) in the range from 30 to 100>The intensity increase the light of the lightning and its durate.>You can type IGNORE in this field and trng will use the most common value for this setting>>SoundEffect field>----------------->Here you type the number of sound effect you wish was played when the lightning it will be performed.>Note: if you wish supply a sound effect you have to add to the Lightning field the LGTN_PLAY_SOUND flag.>>Size field>---------->This should be the diameter size of the lightning but it has not a precise reference to the effective size.>I presume it was a magnifying factor about the "lighting" sprite used to create this effect.>Reasonable values for this field will be in the range from 20 to 40>If you type IGNORE in this field, trng will use the most common value for this setting>>ParticleDurate field>-------------------->This value is the persistence of particles used to create the lightning.>Reasonable values are in the range from 20 to 40>If you type IGNORE in this field,  trng will use the most common value for this setting>>IntervalTime field>------------------>This field is a bit complicated to explain but it's very important when you wish simulate the lightning conductor.>Differently, you should type 0 (or IGNORE) in this field when you wish simulate the sky lightning.>The value in this field will be used to compute a pause between a shooting of a lightning and the next, when you set (in the trigger) a long time.>For long time I mean also only 30 tick frames (one second) or more.>The problem is that a lightning uses a lot of particles and when you set to show a lightning for some time, in the reality it will be shout a big number of lightnings, one for each frame.>If we don't set a pause between a lightning and following, it happens something that I'm not able to describe, but it's something of evil, that you don't want see in your level.>To avoid this collapse of the particle system and lightning skill, it's necessary set a pause that it should be about the time used from the particles used for the previous lightning to let them to vanish in normal way.>The value you type in this field will work in inverse mode with the ParticleDurate field.>In this field you have to type the denominator of a fration where we have "1" as numerator.>This will be the times that the lightning will be shot, while the other times there will be a pause.>For example  1/4  means, it will be shot once every four times.>As further complication you can choose for this field only powers by 2, like 2,4 ,8, 16, 32 ect.>>A reasonable value for this field is 4 or 8, but it depends by the value you typed in Intensity field and in ParticleDurate field.>Bigger values you chose for those fields and bigger should be IntervalTime, too.>>Note: if you type huge value (anyway the max value is 128), you solve the collapsing problem and you get a long pause between a lightning and the next.>To compute the pause time you can perform the computation: IntervalTime / 30, to get the seconds of pause between a shot and another.>For example typing 32, you get about a lightning every second, in spite that a lightning goes on for about half second so the time with no lightning effect on the screen will be shorter>>Alfa field>---------->The generic name "alfa" is because I've not yet discovered the menaning of this argument.>It has always very low values (0,1,3 are the most used). Pheraps they are flags rather than a quantity.>You can do experiments to discover what changes, modifying this argument, or you can type IGNORE in this field and it will be used the most common value>>Beta field>---------->Same speech as for the above Alfa field.>Anyway in this case it appears like it was the intensity of some sharping, blurrying effect of the lightning.>Increasing this value, it becomes like smoke, and increasing more it becomes transparent until to disappear by all.>This argument has usually 3 or 5 like values.>>You can type IGNORE in this field and it will be used the most common value

PARAM_WTEXT:14 ;Used to store parameters to print string with font of Windows>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_WTEXT, IdParameter, Flags (WTF_...), WindowsFontId, TimeDurate, Left, Top, Right, Bottom>>IdParameter field>----------------->You type an id to identify this parameters command when you'll link it with some trigger to print windows texts.>>Flag (WTF_... field>-------------------->You can type one or more WTF_ (Windows Text Flags) flag.>You can type IGNORE in this field if you wish omit flags.>>WindowsFontId field>------------------->This is the ID of some WindowsFont command where you set font and some settings to use in this printing.>Note: it's better that the WindowsFont command was placed first (above) of current Parameters= command.>>TimeDurate field>---------------->Here you type the number of tick frames (one tick frame = 1/30th of second) that the text will be showed on the screen.>If you type IGNORE (or -1, that is the same), the text will be showed forever. In this case you'll have to call another trigger (F364) to remove the text when you wish.>>Left, Top, Right, Bottom fields>------------------------------->When you print using windows text you have to identify a bounding box in the screen where the text will be aligned in according with the alignment flags you set in the linked WindowsFont command.>The values are in microunits, where 1000 is the max width or height of screen.>For example the box:>>0 , 0, 1000, 1000>>Bound all screen, and this setting is good for a long, multiline central alignment.>You can use the [Get Screen Frames] in the [Tool] panel of NG_Center to compute the zone where show/align your text.>This work is very alike than that you used in Diary, with a page to text showed in an ideal box of the screen.

PARAM_RECT:15 ;Used with parameters= script command>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_RECT, RectId, XOrigin, YOrigin, Width, Height, ForeColor, BackColor>>This parameter could be used to store infos about screen rectangle.>>RectId field>------------->Id to identify this PARAM_RECT parameters. You'll use this value to reference your rectangle in the script commands or triggers that requires it.>>XOrigin field>------------->This is the X origin of the rectangle, it is the left side of rectangle.>>YOrigin field>------------->This is the Y origin of the rectangle, it is the top side of the rectangle>>Width field>----------->This is the x size, the width, of the rectangle>>Height field>------------>This is the y size, the height of the rectangle>>ForeColor field>---------------->Optonal field. Where it is required you can type here the ID of a ColorRGB command to set the foreground color of the rectangle>Note: usually the foreground color is the frame that bounds the rectangle>If it is not foreseen to supply a foreground color you can type IGNORE in this field>>BackColor field>--------------->Optonal field. Where it is required you can type here the ID of a ColorRGB command to set the background color of the rectangle>Note: usually the background color is the inside (and wider) zone of the rectangle>If it is not foreseen to supply a background color you can type IGNORE in this field

PARAM_SWAP_ANIMATIONS:16 ;used with Paramaters= script command>Syntax: Paramaters=PARAM_SWAP_ANIMATIONS, ASwapId, SourceFirstAnim, TargetFirstAnim, NumberOfAnimations>>This paramater host data for flipeffect 393.>The F393 trigger swap animations from SourceFirstAnim to TargetFirstAnim. The animation slots swapped will be NumberOfAnimations.>>Usually, you'll perform another swap of same set of animations to restore previous situation.>>ASwapId field>------------->A progressive id to identify these paramter data. You'll chose this id in F393 trigger to link it with swapping data of this specific parameters=PARAM_SWAP_ANIMATIONS command.>>SourceFirstAnim field>--------------------->You type here the animation number of first animation of the group of animation slot to swap.>Remember that it's necessary that both group of animations to swap was in the same slot, i.e. store for the same object type.>Remember that the indices are zero based. This means that if you wish replace all first 8 animations (for instance) you'll type "0" to choose first animation slot.>>TargetFirstAnim field>--------------------->In this field you type the first benginning animation of the second group whom swap the animations.>Please note that nothing changes if you invert the values in the TargetFirstAnim field with that of SourceFirstAnim, since this is a swapping and at end both group animation will be yet present in the slot, but in different (inverted) position.>>NumberOfAnimations field>------------------------>In this field you type the number of animations to swap, i.e. the number of animations for each group to swap.>You can swap a single animation, typing 1, or a bigger number, anyway take care to do not overlap the two, target and soruce, groups.>For instance this parameter is surely wrong:>>Parameteres=PARAM_SWAP_ANIMATIONS, 0,  4, 6>>Because the number of animation to swap (6) is bigger than the distance between first source anim (0) and first target anim (4), in this way you'll mess the animations of that slot.

PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH:17 ;Used with Parameters= command>Syntax: Parameters= PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH, SpeechId, SpeechFlags (SPCF_...), Parameter, FrameRate,  SpeechSlot, HeadSlotMesh, FirstMeshIndex, SpeechMeshAmount, CommandArray>>The data of PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command will be used to change in sequenze the head of current actor (set via action trigger) to simulate talking.>>SpeechId field>-------------->Set here a progressive number to idenfity current PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command to choose with action trigger.>>SpeechFlags (SPCF_...) field>--------------------------->You can add one or more SPCF_ flags to customize the talking effect>You can type IGNORE to omit flags.>See description of SPCF_ flags in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section of Reference panel.>>Parameter field>--------------->This field could store an optional value working in according with some SPC_ flag.>See description of SPCF_ flags to discover what you can type in Parameter field>>FrameRate field>--------------->For frame rate we mean the ration between animation of the head (swapping of heads to simulate animated face) and the number of frames.>Pratically, the default framerate is 5. If you type IGNORE in this field this means you don't wish change frame rate and it will remain the default value: 5 frames for each head type.>If you type 6, each different head will be keeped for 6 frames.>Therefor if you wish slow down the moving of the mouth you have to increase the frame rate, while to increase the speed you have to reduce the frame rate>>Note: the framerate value will affect only those speech command where you have not set (or it's not possible) the number of frames to keep that head.>The other speech commands, where you set the number of frame, will be not affected by frame rate field.>>SpeechSlot field>---------------->You type here the slot name (or number) from where take the different heads to simulate talking.>All further heads will be taken from following meshes.>You can use different slots, each of them with only an head mesh (old method), or from a single slot with many head meshes (new method).>>HeadSlotMesh field>------------------>In this field you type the index of mesh corresponding to the head of actor.>With lara it will be 14, for Jean Yves is 18, for Von Croy is 21 ect.>>Note: when you use SPCF_OLD_SPEECH_SLOTS method, this HeadSlotMesh index will be the same of FirstMeshIndex field, while with new method the FirstMeshIndex value could be any you wish, and it will be very often 0, if you place first speech mesh in first mesh of speech slot.>>FirstMeshIndex field>-------------------->In this field you have to type the index (the same format you see in Animation Editor of wad merger) of the first mesh for talking in SpeechSlot object.>For instance, if you use old format (SPCF_OLD_SPEECH_SLOTS flag) the mesh index for lara will be 14, because this is the index of head of lara in LARA_SPEECH_HEAD1/2/3/4 slots.>Differently, if you use new method (omitting SPCF_OLD_SPEECH_SLOTS flag), the index should be 0 for lara, while for other actors it will be the index of first talking head for the wished actor.>>SpeechMeshAmount field>---------------------->In this field you type the number of different heads used to simulate talking.>Please, remember that this amount is different than number of different heads you can store, furtherly to simulate expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised ect.) The expression heads will be used with direct command SPC_MESH and they should be not counted in the SpeechMeshAmount value.>For instance, if you use the commons Head_speech_lara1/2/3/4  you'll type 4 in SpeechMeshAmount field.>>CommandArray fields>------------------->From this field you can type a serie of different values divided by commas.>Each value is a command and it will have a SPC_ (SPeech Command) value with (+ sign) some value to set relative mesh number or number of frames, in according with speech command used.>The general formula is:>>SPC_ command + Frame*64 + MeshIndex>>Where:>- Frame is the number of frames to show current mesh. Range for frame is 1 / 63. If you don't set this value (letting 0), it will be used the framerate value as frame durate.>>- MeshIndex is the relative index, beginning from first speech mesh of given slot. Range for meshIndex is 0 / 63>>Above formula could have some exception (like it happens with SPC_HEAD/LOOK/PLAY commands.)>>See description of different SPC_... commands to know the right syntax for each command.

PARAM_INPUT_BOX:18 ;Used with Parameters= commmand>>Syntax: Parameters= PARAM_INPUT_BOX, InputBoxId, BckImageId, WFontId, MaxChars, SfxSound, Flags (RIB_  values), ExtraParam>>The data of PARAM_INPUT_BOX paramaters will be used to show (whereby a flipeffect) a background image where the player will be able to type characters (letters and/or digits) on screen. At end of this operation some trng variables ("Last Input Number" and "Last Input Text") will host the typed text and, when it is only digit text, the final number typed by user.>When you use Input Box in "only digits" mode, it will work like a 2D graphic Keypad, pratically, but now you have also the chance to get common words in "password" style, accepting letters and digits.>>InputBoxId field>----------------->Set here a progressive number to idenfity current PARAM_INPUT_BOX command from others, to choose it with a flipeffect trigger.>You can have a max of 100 PARAM_INPUT_BOX  for level with ID values upto 999>>BckImageId field>----------------->You have to supply a background image to host the Input Box feature.>In this field you'll type the Id of an Image= script command with data about image to use as background for input box.>>Note: since Input Box feature is a bit different matter than a common image, the settings, in the Image= script command, should follow some rules:>>1) The Image= command has to be with IF_FULL_SCREEN + IF_QUIT_ESCAPE flags>>2) The IF_POP_IMAGE flag should be avoided, since only "overlapped" image work fine with Input Box feature, where the program waits for user input>>3) In spite the image will be NOT a pop-up image, you have to type in XPosition, YPosition, SizeX and SizeX fields, valid values. >These microunit values will be used to set the position of the text typed by user (and not, as it happens with common Image, t set the position of the image)>>>WFontId field>------------->This is the ID of a WindowsFont= script command  to set type a font and color, used to write on screen what the player types with the keyboard.>Note: charsets different by western sets are not supported. Indeed, the low-level keyboard reading of Input Box process, reads a standard US/UK qwerty keyboard and, for this reason, further non-western characters will be neither "seen" by the Input Box procedure.>>MaxChars field>-------------->The max number of characters that user will be able to type on screen.>This max length value is important to avoid that, a drunk player, typed plenty of letters, upto ruining the layout of graphic on screen, with text moving outside screen borders.>You should perform a test to verify how many characters will be visible on the screen, in according with the font size you chose, and the start position of text rect. Then you'll type a value (as  MaxChars) a bit less than that max visible number of characters.>>SfxSound field>-------------->Index of sfx effect sound to play everytime the user hits a key of keyboard.>Please note that, if you set IGNORE in this field, this doesn't mean that there will be no sound (silent mode) but only that you wish using a preset sound for hitting key: the sfx sound 109 (MENU_SELECT).>The switching on/off of sounds, it will be affected only by usage (or less) of RIB_SOUND_ON_KEY flag.> >Flags (RIB_  values) field>-------------------------->In this field you can insert one or more RIB_ (Read Input Box) flags linked with "+" operator.>In the case you typed IGNORE in this field, it will be used default settings, corresponding to following flags: >RIB_BLINK_CARET+RIB_SOUND_ON_KEY+RIB_ONLY_CAPS>>ExtraParam field>---------------->This field could keep some parameter in accordingwith some RIB_ flag. >>Read the descriptions of RIB_ constants in MNEMONIC CONSTANTS section of NG_Center's Reference panel, for more infos.

RIB_ONLY_DIGITS:$0001  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX command>Force Input Box to accept only digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Further letters (a,b,c ect) typed by user, will be ignored.>>When you use this flag the user will be able only to type a number (with any digits) and at end , if he validates the input with ENTER, the digits he typed will be stored as number in "Last Input Number" trng variable. In this way, then you'll be able to check that value with other using flipeffect for trng variables.>>Notes: >- If user quits the input box with ESCAPE command, and you used the RIB_ONLY_DIGITS flag, in "Last Input Number" there wil be the "-1" value.>- This flag is uncompatible with RIB_ONLY_LETTERS flag, of course.>- If you omit either RIB_ONLY_DIGITS and RIB_ONLY_LETTERS flags, input box will accept numbers and letters.>- If you omit the RIB_ONLY_DIGITS flag, the "Last Input Number" variable will be not affected by Input Box.

RIB_ONLY_LETTERS:$0002  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX command>Ignores digits (0123456789). With this flag the further digits typed  by user will be ignored.

RIB_HIDE_CARET:$0004  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>Omit to draw a underscore character "_" to simulate the cursor. >By default a cursor will be drawn always at right of last typed character.

RIB_BLINK_CARET:$0008 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>Perform a blinking of the caret while it's waiting input. >The blinking simulates the old MS-DOS prompt.

RIB_SOUND_ON_KEY:$0010  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>Perform a sound effect, whose number you typed in SfxSound field of Parameters command, everytime the player hits a key.

RIB_PRINT_ONLY:$0020  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>With this flag, it happens that the input box will draw on the screen the "Last Input Text" typed text, (and the further BigText) without allowing to the user the chance to type text. In this way the input box works like a common overlapped image with some printed text.>Only one advantage, using Input box in this way, is to have already all settings, about position, color and font, to print the text in right position of previous inserted text.>You should use this flag only with a distinct Paramaters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX command, used only to display error messages.>Indeed, the input box with this flag doesn't allow any kind of text input but only to give the Escape command to quit the input box.

RIB_ALIGN_CENTER:$0040  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>Set a central alignment of text typed by user.>The text will be centered inside of rectangle set in Image script command.>Notes: >- if you omit this flag, the text will be aligned at left>- It's not advisable using central alignment with a blinking caret because, in this case, everytime the caret will disappear, the text will become shorter and the central alignment will move the position, giving the feeling of a text shackering. 																	
RIB_ONLY_CAPS:$0080 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>Force that all text typed by user will be in capital letters. By default, omitting this flag, the text will be drawn lower or capital letters, in according with usage or less of SHIFT key, as in common text editors.

RIB_PRINT_BIG_TEXT:$0100 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>If you set this flag in RIB_Flags field, when the background image of input box has been draw, and first to read/draw the text typed by player, it will be drawn the text of trng variable "Big Text".>When you set this flag, it's necessary type also, in ExtraParam field of Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX script command, the id of some Parameters=PARAM_RECT script command. The data of PARAM_RECT it will be used to set the rectangle (in micro units) where to draw the "Big Text" string. It will be used also the "ForeColor" field (of PARAM_RECT script command), to set the color of the text, while, the "BackColor" field, it will be ignored.>This is the description of RIB_PRINT_BIG_TEXT flag, anyway it should be important also explain why you should use this flag, rather to draw simply, on background image, further text.>The idea, behind RIB_PRINT_BIG_TEXT flag, is to have a generic input box, for instance with a background image showing a computer screen, that you'll be able to use over and over, with different text and therefore, requiring different passwords or input commands, to perform some operations in the game.>If you use this method, you should remember to perform the F409 trigger, to show the input box, within a TriggerGroup, where, first of F409 trigger, there will be a trigger to copy some text (from strings of .dat files) in "Big Text" variable.>In this way you'll be able to customize everytime, in run-time, the texts to show, in this "pc/control panel" input box, in game.

RIB_INPUT_BELOW_BIG_TEXT:$0200 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>This flag could be used only with RIB_PRINT_BIG_TEXT flag.>When you enable the print of a text (that in trng BigText variable) on screen, before waiting for user input, you can use the RIB_INPUT_BELOW_BIG_TEXT flag, to change the Y position (in height axis) of input box rectangle, to show input text immediately below last row of BigText drawn.>In this way the input zone will change in according with last printed text.>Note: this flag affects only the Y position of input box rect, while the relative height of rect or its width and X origin will be not modified.

RIB_ADD_SCANCODE_LIST:$0400 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>This flag allows to expand the scan codes recognized by keyboard parsing procedure.>By default input box parses and recognizes only sure key for all QWERTY keyboard layouts but ignores many keys that change for different kind of nationalized keyboards, like "?", "!", "@" ect.>With this flag you can say to InputBox procedure to check also for other keys, suppling some infos about scancodes and character to display on screen.>>When you add RIB_ADD_SCANCODE_LIST flag, you have to add also a NG extra string with (fixed) number "666" (only to remember it better, don't worry)>The syntax of 666 ng string will be like this:>666: AABBCC, A1B1C1, A2B2C2 ... ect ...>Pratically you type a serie of hexadecimal number (omitting the "$" prefix) divided by commas.>Each hex number gives infos, to input box procedure, about what scan code (read by keyboard) should be parsed (the scan codes value are those you find in "KEYBOARD SCANCODES list" of Reference Panel) and that its corresponding ASCII code to draw on screen.>The "AA" pair will be the ascii code (UTF-7 set) , while the BB (and further, optional, "CC" and "DD") will be single scan code key to be down in same moment, to draw the "AA" ascii code.>For instance, if you wish having also the "?" character, you need to see in Keyboard scancodes list its scan code value. >Now you discover that it is .... MISSING.>The reason is that the scancodes show only the code for each single key of keyboard but some keys (the most) having two or more symbols for each key.>So, thinking about US/UK keyboards, the "?" is over "/" symbol, so you look for the "/" character in Keyboard scancodes list.>Now we find it: "53 ($35) Backslash /">Well, the scan code in hex format is "$35" but to have the "?" on screen we need also to keep down the "SHIFT" key.>To complete our picking up of information we have to discover also the ascii code of "?" character.>It's not present in NG_Center the ascii list, anyway it's easy finding infos on internet, so we discover that the asci code for "?" character is $3F (or 63 in decimal but we'll work only in hex format)>To complete the required infos, we check for scancode of SHIFT: $2A>At end we can create the hex number to add "?" character to input box:>3F352A>Above hex number will add the "?" between printable characters.>You should "read" above number like a serie of 2 hex digits:>"3F": on screen we'll print ascii "3F", i.e. the "?" character>"35" when user hits the key "/" and in same moment there is the>"2A" key down (SHIFT)>>Notes: >- There are two shift keys, left and right, with different scancodes, anyway, since it's not foreseen the "or" operator (to say "this key or this other ...), trng will extend left shift to same shift itself.>This means that, just you type the hex scan code for only one "SHIFT" key and trng will check also for other (left or right shift) key.>>- About the ALT e CTRL keys, the speech above about SHIFT doesn't work, since tomb4 has a limited scanning and doesn't recognize [ALT GR] as right ALT but it sees all ALT like only one.>For CTRL is the same but in this case it's normal that two different CTRL gave same scan code.>>- Max amount of numbers (divided by commas) is 64.>>- Remember that the position of symbols, changes between different keyboard, in accoding with nationality. For this reasone if you wish support interpuntion characters (like "," ":" ";" ect.) you have only two ways:>>1) Using only US/UK layout you should warn the players that some key don't work fine, showing a different character rispet that displaied on their keyboards>>2) Creating two or more "langauge.dat" file, to have different scan codes in according with different layout "german" "french" "italian" ect.>>- Theoratically you could scan also keys that have not a visible character to display, like "F1" "F2" ect. function keys. In this case it's better using also RIB_SHORTCUT_KEY+RIB_HIDE_TEXT  flags.>Then you'll supply, as ascii code, a special character to verify its presence after inputbox.

RIB_SHORTCUT_KEY:$0800  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>Adding this flag, the input box will quit, like it has been set the ENTER command, immediately after first valid key chosen by user.>It should be reccomended, for instance, to handle a menu with a list of commands labeled with a number (1. 2. 3.) or letters (A. B. C. D.)>>Note: this flag doesn't affect any other behaviour of input box, so if you wish that the caret will be hidden or the inserted text not drawn on screen, you'll have to add other flags, like RIB_HIDE_CARET and RIB_HIDE_TEXT.

RIB_HIDE_TEXT:$1000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_INPUT_BOX>This flag will omit, to draw on screen, the keys hit by user.>In spite of this behaviour all valid keys typed by user will be stored in lastInputText variable and LastInputNumber (if only digits).>Usually you'll use this flag togehter with RIB_HIDE_CARET flag and, probably, to manage single key command with RIB_SHORTCUT_KEY flag.

SPC_MESH:$0000 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>With this command you choose directly the head mesh to show.>The number you'll add to SPC_MESH command if the relative index, beginning from zero, respect first speech mesh.>For example:>>SPC_MESH+4>>this means: the fifth mesh (0,1,2,3,4  are 5 meshes)>If you wish set a frame durate different than framerate field, you can add the number of frames for durate:>The number of frames has to be multplied by 64:>For instance:>>SPC_MESH+256+4>>means: show mesh with index=4 (fifth mesh) for 4 frames (4 * 64 = 256)>>Note: Since SPC_MESH command has value = 0, you can omit to type it, just you avoid to insert any other SPC_ command:>>For instance:>>256+4>>is the same of:>>SPC_MESH+256+4>>If you let default frame rate for durate (useful to be able, in a second moment, to change the speed of whole sequence in fast way), you can type simply the number of mesh:>>For instances these:>> 2,1,0,0,2>>are a sequence of SPC_MESH commands with default frame rate of durate.

SPC_SYLL:$1000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This command will show the simulation of a syllable.>In our convention, we define the syllable like a single animation from closed mouth to max-open mouth or vicevera.>This means that, if actor in the moment of this command, had closed the mouth, the syllable command will change heads from closed mouth to max-open mouth.>In the case, differently, at begin of this command, it had a full opened mouth, the syllable command will show in sequence all heads to do close the mouth.>Pratically the SPC_SYLL command is not a single mesh, but an animated sequence of meshes, from mix to max opening of mouth or viceversa.>If you don't add any value to this command, it will be used the default frame rate, and so, each head of animated sequence will be showed for FrameRate durate.>If you wish having a different frame rate only for this command, you can add the number of frames for each head, mutlplying it by 64:>>SPC_SYLL+192>>Since 192 means 3 frames (3*64= 192), each head of animated sequence will be displayed for 3 frames.>>If you add a value between 1 to 64, it will be the number of syllable to be played with this command.>For instance:>>SPC_SYLL+5>>It will show 5 animated sequence of syllable. This means that the mouth will be opened and closed twice, and then another single syllable.


SPC_TEXT:$2000 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This command will draw the extra ng string whom index you typed as argument.>Example:>>SPC_TEXT+23>>It will draw the extra ng string with index = 23.>About this command it's important remember the flipeffects F399/400/401 whereby those you can set only once at start the position and color of texts for each actor, in this way in the speech commands you can simply set the string with SPC_TEXT command and it will be drawn with color and position for the actor linked with this speech command.>Note: all texts will remain on screen until you don't set another SPC_TEXT command for same actor, or when you use the syntax:>>SPC_TEXT+0  >>The string with index = 0 will be read as "remove previous text and do not print any string for current actor">You can also omit the +0 argument, of course.>>SPC_TEXT >>with no string index supplied has same meaning.


SPC_SEQUENCE:$3000 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This command allows you to have a custom seuquence of meshes but for other expressions.>It simulates the opening and closing mouth with a sequence of heads, in same way you can simulate other expression, like smiling, angrious ect.>>You have to supply two number:>>- The index of first mesh of animated sequence>- The number of mesh used in this sequence>>With this command is not possible set the frame durate of animation, it will be used the default frame rate set.>>Formula to type values for this command is:>>SPC_SEQUENCE + NumberOfMesh* 64 + IndexFirstMesh>>For instance:>>SPC_SEQUENCE + 256 + 12>>It means: the aimated sequence begins from mesh with index = 12 and the mesh of sequence are 4 (4 * 64 = 256)

SPC_PAUSE:$4000 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>With this command you can do a pause with a closed mouth of the actor for the given frames.>>SPC_PAUSE + FramesOfPause>>For instance:>>SPC_PAUSE + 45>>With above command the actor will remain mute (closed mouth) for about one second and half (45 frames)>>By default the number of frame is the durate of the pause but you can use also SPC_PAUSE to align speech commands with demo frames of current demo is playing.>In this case we speak about "absolute" frame (while the durate is a "relative" frame, i.e. relative to current demo frame + the durate you set).>To force an absolute frame you have to add to the argument also the special constant "DEMO_FRAME".>>For example:>>SPC_PAUSE+DEMO_FRAME+136>>Above command means: "wait until the demo frame counter reachs the 136th frame.>In this way you are sure that next command will be performed at demo frame 136.>The DEMO_FRAME constant is very useful to syncrhonize speech commands with current demo.>>notes: >- Please note that with this command the valid range of pause durate value (relative or absolute) is 1 / 2047>- In the case you use absolute pause (using DEMO_FRAME) but that demo frame was already elapsed there will be no pause and the next command will be immediatly performed.

DEMO_FRAME:$0800 ;Used with SPC_PAUSE command of Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This is a special flag that you can use only adding it to SPC_PAUSE command to force an absolute pause until current demo reaches the given frame.>See the SPC_PAUSE command for more infos.


SPC_LOOK_RIGHT:$5000 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>Move the head at right.>This command accept two arguments:>- The angle about turning respect to forward looking (0 degrees)>- The time spent for turning and still in turned position.>>Since both arguments cann't be bigger than value 63, to have a larger choice the format is not in frame and single degrees but rather:>- The angle will be set in double degrees of wished degrees. In this way if you type 45 the turning will be by 90 degrees.>- The durate is in teenths of second, so with max value, 63, you can reach six seconds of right looking. The durate has to be multiplied by 64.>>For instance, if you wish a turning of 45 degrees, kept for 2.5 seconds, the formula will be:>>SPC_LOOK_RIGHT+22+1600>>The 22 will be multiplied by 2 from trng to get 44 (about 45), while 1600 is 25 * 64, and 25 teenth of second are 2.5 seconds, of course.>>Notes: >>- All SPC_LOOK... and SPC_HEAD_ commands work only with Lara. If you wish have same effect for other moveable it will be necessary creating a new custom animation to move the head and then use a SPC_ANIMATION command to force that animation.>>- All SPC_LOOK and SPC_HEAD commands will be overlapped to the following commands in their playing. >This means that this command will start immediatly the turning of head, but in same frame, it will begin also next command, for example to move actor's mouth.>If you wish that trng waits that the turning was completed before performing next command, you have to add after this LOOK command a SPC_PAUSE command with the same time durate of this LOOK command.


SPC_LOOK_LEFT:$6000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>Move the head at left for wished degrees and frame durate.>See the description of SPC_LOOK_RIGHT command to know the syntax of the formula.

SPC_LOOK_UP:$7000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>Move the head upward for wished degrees and frame durate.>See the description of SPC_LOOK_RIGHT command to know the syntax of the formula.


SPC_LOOK_DOWN:$8000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>Move the head downward for wished degrees and frame durate.>See the description of SPC_LOOK_RIGHT command to know the syntax of the formula.

SPC_HEAD_SHAKE:$9000 ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This command will simulate the shaking head to show the feeling to say: "no, I don't...", "it's not true" ect.>You can set two values with this command: >- The speed of shacking movement>- The angle in degrees of the head turning, computed for each side. >>To add these values you have to use following formula:>>SPC_HEAD_SHAKE + Speed * 64 + Angle>>Speed value is the turning increment given in degrees. Each increment will be added at each frame. >For instance to have a shacking of 20 degrees at speed of 3 degrees for frame you'll type:>>SPC_HEAD_SHAKE + 192 + 20>>Where, 190 is 3 (degrees) * 64 and 20 is the angle for a single side.>>Note: remember that for both arguments the max value is 63.

SPC_HEAD_NOD:$A000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This command works like SPC_HEAD_SHAKE command but in this case the head movement will be up/down insteady by left/right.>Moving up/down the head means "yes", "ok", "it's true", "I agree" ect.>Note: really the movement will be not with same angle upstairs and downstairs, since the nod is more with downstairs moving.>Trng will simulate this behavior using the angle supplied for down but only the half of that angle for upper movement.>>About syntax of arguments see the description of SPC_HEAD_SHAKE command.


SPC_PLAY_SFX:$B000  ;Used with Parameters=PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH command>This command will play the sfx sound you set as argument.>For example:>>SPC_PLAY_SFX+104>>It will play the 104 sound (HECKLER_KOCH_STOP) >Range of values is 0/4095

The pop up images are always showed supporting the transparent color.>>- The LDF_TRANSPARENT_BKG flag doens't work fine with the PL_FIX_WIDE_SCREEN flag about page layout, because, when there is a wide-screen and this flag, the image will be stretched before showing it and in this phase the transparence effect will show a distorsion between real background and new stretched background in transparent zones.>>- If you use LDF_TRANSPARENT_BKG flag togheter with LDF_ZOOM_START flag, for technical reasons, the image showed in the zoom effect will have no texts and neither further pop-up image. Pratically it will be zoomed only first background images for diary, and only when zoom effect has been completed, it will be added texts and pop up images.>>- If you mean set a transparent zone in the background of your diary it's necessary that all (further) background images (you can change the background for each page) had the transparency in same zones, otherwise you'll get a transparency only showing a zone of previous page instead of tomb raider screen.

PL_RIGHT_IMAGE_LOGO:5  ;Used in Diary= command.>This layout is similar than PL_RIGHT_IMAGE layout, but in this case there is a single text frame in bottom half size of tomb screen, while the frame at top-left of screen will be let empty.>Like for PL_LEFT_IMAGE_LOGO, you could use this layout to host in this "empty" top-left frame your logo for your adventure, drawing this image directly in background image for diary.>>Remark: when you select a PL_LEFT_IMAGE_LOGO or PL_RIGHT_IMAGE_LOGO layout, wheter a page has no little image to show, the whole top-half of tomb screen will be let empty to avoid to type over the logo zone.

PL_CENTRAL_IMAGE:6  ;Used in Diary= command.>In this layout the further image will be showed at center of screen in top-half side.>Thre width of image in this layout is a bit larger than left/right layouts: the 60% of screen versus the 40% of previous layouts

PL_WIDE_IMAGE:7  ;Used in Diary= command.>This layout is very similar than above PL_CENTRAL_IMAGE layout, but in this case the image will be fit to cover the 90% of screen.>If you use this layout you should create the image to be wide but not very heigh, otherwise it could cover the whole tomb raider screen.>The usage of this layout could be useful to show two little image in each page, the trick is simply to create a unique image where there are two pictures one at left and the other at right.

PL_ADD_INFO_BAR:$100  ;Used in Diary= command.>Differently by other PL_ flags, you can add the PL_ADD_INFO_BAR to another (but only one) PL_ flag.>Adding the PL_ADD_INFO_BAR to some other layout you inform trng that in current layout the bottom row of screen should be reserved and no text of diary should be typed over it.>You can use this flag when you want use the bottom strip of background image to show arrows or some short infos about keyboard commands to manage Lara's diary.>Pratically when trng detects this flag, it will format the text avoiding to cover also bottom row of screen, in this way you can dedicate that bottom zone with little icons or info texts.>>Remark: the infos you could insert in Info bar are the description of keyboard commands accepted by Lara's Diary:>>RIGHT ARROW  = Show next page>LEFT ARROW = Show previous page>HOME = show first page of diary>END = show last page of diary>ESCAPE = exit from Diary>SPACE = Zoom Image (show further little image of page at full screen). Newly SPACE to come back to original size.

PL_CUSTOM_LAYOUT:$200  ;Used in Diary= command.>If you are not satisfacted by other preset layouts you can create your own layout using this flag.>When you set PL_CUSTOM_LAYOUT (omitting all other PL_  layouts) trng engines will expect to find directly in the text to show the infos about layout to use.>In the <FORMAT> section of text you can place these three tag formatters:>>#FRAME_IMG#=XPos,YPos,SizeX,SizeY>#FRAME_T1#=XPos,YPos,SizeX,SizeY>#FRAME_T2#=XPos,YPos,SizeX,SizeY>>and trng engine will use these frames to show the text and the further image.>>All values are in micro units. You can use the utility [Get Screen Frames] in Tools panel of NG_Center program to get the correct values to type (XPos,YPos,SizeX,SizeY)>>You can set a different layout for each page. When trng shows a page where there is no custom layout.>If you wish set a PL_ layout in Diary command, and also a format tag in some page, that page will be showed using the format tag, while other following pages with no format tag will be showed newly in PL_ layout you set in Diary command.>>To know all tags you can use <FORMAT> section of text, see the description of Diary= command in New Script commands section of Reference panel of NG_Center.


PL_FIX_WIDE_SCREEN:$400 ;Used in Diary= command.>When the game was played at full screen on a wide-screen monitor the images of Diary will be distorted and lara will become an obese dwarf.>If you want avoid this deformation you can set this flag. When trng finds the PL_FIX_WIDE_SCREEN flag, it will show the background image of diary non at full-screen but with a width a bit littler than screen to preserve the normal ratio between width-height with a ratio of 1.3 ([width] divided by [height] = 1.3)>In this wieving at left and right of diary there will be two empty columns.>This look could be good if you in background image draw a book style image.

CODE_FLIPEFFECT:$0400 ;Used in Plugin= command.>In DisableFeatureArray of Plugin command you can disabling the changes that, given plugin, did about a standard trng flipeffect.>For instance if you don't agree the changes about flipeffect 132 you can type in DisableFeatureArray the value:>>CODE_FLIPEFFECT + 132>>And trng will forbid to given plugin to change code of flipeffect 132

CODE_ACTION:$0800 ;Used in Plugin= command.>In DisableFeatureArray of Plugin command you can disabling the changes that, given plugin, did about a standard trng action trigger.>For instance if you don't agree the changes about action 41 you can type in DisableFeatureArray the value:>>CODE_ACTION + 41

CODE_CONDITION:$1000 ;Used in Plugin= command.>In DisableFeatureArray of Plugin command you can disabling the changes that, given plugin, did about a standard trng condition trigger.>For instance if don't agree the changes about condition 23 you can type in DisableFeatureArray the value:>>CODE_CONDITION + 23

MPS_DISABLE:$40000000 ;used in Plugin= command.>This flag should be used only temporarily as experiment.>When you add MPS_DISABLE flag to MainPluginSettings field, that plugin will be ignored by trng, pratically like its library.dll was not present in trle.>This is a way to verify if some problem or weirdness happens for this plugin, without the need to remove it physically from trle and ng_center folders.>>Note: You should understand that the simple removing of Plugin= script command, with a ";" character for instance, could not have the same effect of MPS_DISABLE flag. Because the removing of the plugin= script command from the script, it will not affect the loading of plugin library in tomb4 and its execution.

WFF_BOLD:$0001  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>A bold character has a big "heavy" layout, pratically the depth of drawn is bigger than normal or light character.>If the background, where the text will be showed, is not solid tint, it's better use a bold or ultra_bold character otherwire in some combination of text color - background color the border could be not well visible.

WFF_ULTRA_BOLD:$0002  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>This is the max heavy for character: the depth of drawn will be the max available. If you want have "fat" characters this is the ideal setting but it works fine always when the size set for this font is big, differently, using a little font an ultra bold could cause a very leak text.>

WFF_LIGHT:$0004  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>This setting generates very slim characters. You should use this setting only when background is a solid tint, otherwise the border of characters will be few visible on multicolor background.>Remark: if you don't set : light, bold or ultra_bold, the character will have a normal depth, really a bit slim, too.

WFF_SHADOW:$0008  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>If you add this flag in WindowsFontFlags field, each character will have a sort of shadow.>Technically this effect requires to print two times the same text, moving by a bit of pixels the position, and using two different colors.>By default the shadow will be black, anyway you can change the color for shadow using the ShadowColorRgbId field.>The shadow has two targets: create a simil-border to get more visible the text also over multicolor backgrounds, and to realize a 3d effect, where the effective text could seem it was upstairs a wall where the shadow of this text has been casted.>Remark: this effect works fine with bold or ultra-bold characters, while less well with little/light caracters.

WFF_ITALIC:$0010  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>The italic attribute creates a character a bit inclined.

WFF_UNDERLINE:$0020  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>Adding the WFF_UNDERLINE flag, all text will be underlined.>This setting could be useful for text used as title.

WFF_LEFT_ALIGN:$0080  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>The text will be aligned on left margin of text frame.>Remark: this is also the default value and it will be used also if you type IGNORE in WindowFontFlags field


WFF_RIGHT_ALIGN:$0100  ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>The text will be aligned on right margin of text frame.

WFF_CENTER_ALIGN:$0200   ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>The will be centerd at half of text frame.>This align mode is suggested for titles.

WFF_FORCE_FIXED_PITCH:$0400 ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>This flag force trng to choose a font with fixed pitch charaters.>Theorically it should be sufficent to choose a font name of fixed pitch like "courier" but in the reality, performing some test, I discovered that sometimes windows font procedure prefers choose a different face name font only to reach other parameters like size of font.>To avoid this doubt you can add the WFF_FORCE_FIXED_PITCH flag and the characters will be surely with fixed pitch.>The fixed pitch (all characers will have always same width) is very useful when you want create text tables like in savegame panel.

WFF_ROTATE_90:$0800 ;Used in WindowsFont= command.>The text will be turned by 90 degrees in clockwise mode.>Note: there are some limitations for this flag.>>- It will work only with single-row string. This means that the further new line characters ("\n") will be ignored.>You should print a single row at once. If you wish print many rows you'll have to print different single row one by one, changing the origin of rectangle in correct way, everytime.>>- You have to use a true type font, otherwise the rotation will not work.>>- In the rectangle data of Parameters=PARAM_WTEXT command it will be used the (left,top) to set the orgin, and the difference between left and right to compute the length of the text (in vertical since it has been turned) with the computation (right - left = length of vertical text)

WFF_ROTATE_INV_90:$1000 ;Used in WindowsFont= command>The text will turned by 90 degress in inverted clockwise mode.>>Using this flag there are some limitation and technical requirements. See the description of WFF_ROTATE_90 flag for more infos

WFF_FROM_RIGHT_TO_LEFT:$2000 ;Used in WindowsFont= command>The text will be displayed from right to left. >Example:>the string:>>"ABCDEF">>will be showed in this way:>>"FEDCBA">>Note: this flag works only with hebrew and arabic computers and you have also to set the correct charset value in the WindowsFont.

WFF_UNICODE:$4000 ;Used in WindowsFont= command>If you wish show a text with eastern charset, perhaps you'll need also to set this flag to show correctly your string.>Unicode is UTF16, a fixed 2 bytes (16 bits), encoding method.>In the case you use unicode you'll have to type your string, using the "binary hex string" format.>This is a necessary "trick" to around the problem that NG_Center program doesn't support unicode texts.>To add an unicode string in string panel of NG_Center, you'll have to:>>1) Open block notes or other (simple) text editor of your computer>2) Type the original text in your language, included in two "$$$$" markers.>Example:>If your text is "MyText">you'll type into block notes:>>$$$$MyText$$$$>>3) Save this text in a file on disk>4) Go to the String panel of NG_Cnter, and enable [ExtraNG] section.>5) Click to [Add new string]>6) Now click on [Import Binary String] button>7) Choose the file where you saved your original text>8) Now you can choose if you wish keep this text in an external file ("@FileName.txt") or you want keep the binary string directly in hex format.

WFF_UTF8:$8000  ;Used in WindowsFont= command>If you wish print text with eastern fonts, probably you'll have to add this flag to inform trng that your text is encoded with multibytes format.>When you chose the WFF_UTF8 flag, trng engine will manage the text you wish print, as it was an UTF8 text, and this means that tnrg will convert in (at fly) in unicode before printing it.>For this reason when you add the WFF_UTF8 flag, it's futile add (or less) the WFF_UNICODE flag, since this operation will be performed by trng itself.>About the choice between UTF8 and UNICODE, you should try to see if NG_Center with the correct charset is able to support your language.>To set a charset for NG_Center, different than default ANSI/western charset, you should use the translation file.>If you have not a translation file for ng_Center, you can create a fake translation file in this way:>>1) Open block notes, and type this text with your LanguageName and CharsetNumber:>>[START_CONFIGURATION]>Version=LanguageName>Charset=CharSetNumber>PropFont=Arial>FixedFont=Courier>[END]>>note: In above text, you have to replace the "[" character with the "less than" character, and the "]" character, with the "greater than" character. I cann't use them in this text for a problem of internal format of this help file.>>2) Now save this text in NG_Center folder, giving the name "my_scripter_constants.txt">>3) Now, close NG_Center, and launch it newly. >>4) Now in Settings panel you should see your language (you typed in Version= command).>If it's not selected, select it now>>5) Now ng_center will support the charset you typed (CharSetNumber) and the wished font.>You have to try if you are able to type text in [Strings] section, in your language, and if this texts, after saving, quit program and launch newly program, they stand yet there.>>In the case your language is not yet supported by NG_Center you'll have to use binary strings.>A binary string is sequence of hex values with the codes used to print a text.>Read the description of WFF_UNICODE flag, to understand how to get a binary string from your original text.>>About the choice between UTF8 and UNICODE (it should be UTF16) it depends by your language.>Languages like chinese, corean and japanese work with UNICODE, while other middle-east languages, like russian, turkish or greek, could work with UTF8.>Anyway there are also simplified versions of chinese and japanese that may be supported by UTF8.>Probably you'll have to do some experiment to discover the best settings for your language.

IF_TRANSPARENCE:$0001  ;Used in Image= command.>If you want was applied a transparence effect on current image you can add this flag.>The transparent zone will be  where there are pixels with rgb color = $FF00FF  (red = 255; green=0; blue=255), this is the traditional transparent color for tomb raider textures.>With transparent images you can create, for example,a round image over the game screen, where the non visible squared corners have been filled with transparent color.>>Remarks: >* The transparency effect is a bit slow to realize, so it's advisable to use it with moderation.>>* If you want place the CONVERTER.exe utility in your level files to develope the images in jpg format, you should avoid to supply the transparent image in .jpg format, because the double conversion bmp->jpg (when you place the images in your zip file) and the final re-conversion jpg->bmp (before playing your level) could alterate the transparent color in some side, ruining the final effect of transparency. In this situation you can simply supply the other images in .jpg format, while the image with transparency will be let in original .bmp format, in this way CONVERTER.exe (or trlm2009) will convert only other images, letting untouched your transparent (bmp) image.>>* When you create your transparent image you should disable the anti-aliasing feature in photoshop because, otherwise, the line between solid color and transparent color could be alterated with colors only similar to transparent color but not exaclty precise. Only the absolutly precise color 255,0,255 will be transparent, so you should avoid any distorsion.

IF_POP_IMAGE:$0002 ;Used in Image= command.>This flag will change fully the work mode about viewing of image.>A pop up image, in fact, will be drawn over the game screen letting the game goes on, differently, a non pop up image, will be drawn over game screen while the game is still.>For this reason, the pop up image will be usually littler than game screen, used as a sort of tv logo, while, differently, the non pop up images, could be drawn covering whole game screen, and stopping it upto the view time was completed.>>I wish to precise: above is not a fixed rule but only a reasonable suggestion.>The only precise rule is that with pop up image the game will go on, while with non pop up images the game will be frozen upto the viewing of image has been completed.

IF_FULL_SCREEN:$0004 ;Used in Image= command.>This settings will show the image resizing it to cover whole game screen.>When this flag is present the fields used to set origin and size of image (XPosition, YPosition, SizeX, SizeX) will be ignored, so you can fill them with four IGNORE values.

IF_OVER_FLYBY:$0008 ;Used in Image= command.>This flag works only with pop up images.>By default when a flyby sequence begins the further pop up image will be hidden, like other special objects (keypad, detector or picked up items), but if you want have a pop up image showed over a flyby sequence you can add this flag to ImageFlags field.

IF_QUIT_ESCAPE:$0010 ;Used in Image= command.>This flag works only for NON pop up images.>When you show an image that freezes the game, you can set this flag to permit at player to skip the image with Escape/Inventory keystroke.

IF_EFFECT_ZOOM:$0020 ;Used in Image= command.>With this effect the image will showed with a zoom effect.>At start the image will be drawn at 1/10 of its size, then in EffectTime frames it will be mangnified until to reach the size and position you chose with XPos, YPos, SizeX and SizeY fields.>In EffectTime field you should set the number of frames (1/32 of second) required for zoom effect. If you set a low EffectTime the zoom will be very fast, while if the EffectTime is high the effect will be slow.>>Remark: this effect could slow down the game when you apply it to pop up images.

IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP:$0040  ;Used in Image= command.>This effect move the image from top of screen upto reach the final position you set in field PosX,PosY,SizeX and SizeY.>The whole moving effect will be perfomed in the frames you set in EffectTime field.>Little values as EffectTime will produce most fast in the moving.>>Remarks: >>* At start of this effect the image will be whole outside of screen, for this reason you can apply this effect also for images to show in full screen size.

IF_EFFECT_FROM_BOTTOM:$0080  ;Used in Image= command.>This effect is similar to IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP effect but in this case the image will enter in the screen from bottom side of scren.>See description of IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP flag for most informations.

IF_EFFECT_FROM_LEFT:$0100  ;Used in Image= command.>This effect is similar to IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP effect but in this case the image will enter in the screen from left side of scren.>See description of IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP flag for most informations.

IF_EFFECT_FROM_RIGHT:$0200  ;Used in Image= command.>This effect is similar to IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP effect but in this case the image will enter in the screen from right side of scren.>See description of IF_EFFECT_FROM_TOP flag for most informations.

IF_PLAY_AUDIO_TRACK:$0400  ;Used in Image= command.>If you wish have a sound start in same moment of image viewing you can add this flag and type in AudioTrack field a number between 0 and 255 to locate an audio track of AUDIO folder.>For example if you want play the track "034.wav" you have to type 34 in AudioTrack field.

IF_PRELOAD:$0800  ;Used in Image= command.>By default the image will be loaded from disk in same moment it should be drawn on screen. >This operation requires sometimes some instant and the game remains froze for that short period.>To avoid this stop you can force trng to preload the image while it is loading other data of current level (when you see the loading bar on screen)>In this way the image will be already in RAM memory and it will be displayed immediatly.>Remark: since the bmp images could be very heavy (one MB or more) it's advisable don't exagerate with the number of preloaded images for same level. I suggest to remain in the complessive limit of 15 Mb of preloaded images in same level.>Differently the size of images preloaded in different levels is not cumulative since trng will discard them when a level has been discarded, of course.

IF_OVER_FIXED_CAMERA:$1000 ;Used in Image= command.>By default the images will be hidden when there is a fixed camera. If you wish keep this image on game screen also when there is a fixed camera you can add the IF_OVER_FIXED_CAMERA flag.

IF_LOOP_AUDIO_TRACK:$2000 ;Used in Image= command.>If you enable a background audio track for your image, using the IF_PLAY_AUDIO_TRACK flag, you can choose to perform that audio track in loop (infinite) way, adding the IF_LOOP_AUDIO_TRACK flag.

IF_CRYPTIC:$4000 ;Used in Image= command.>If you add this flag to your Image command, the corresponding image will be crypted and its name will be changed from: Image#.bmp  to @Image#.bmp>Once the image has been crypted (and you recognize the crypted images from the "@" character in front of their name), it will be no more possible load and view this image in common ways. >Only playing the level, the trng engine will decrypt at-fly the image to show it in game.>This crypting feature has been thought to avoid that some "old-fox" player, went to watch the images in Pix folder, in advance, to discover secret maps and other stuff about the playing of your level>>Notes>----->* It's strongly suggested to perform a backup in other folder of your original (not yet crypted) images, because, once they have been crypted, there is no way to decrypt them, and therefor you'll lose any chance to modify them.>>* No decrypting tool has been supplied in ng_center, because the (above) old-fox player, could download ng_center own to decrypt the images of the level he is playing. But this chance has not been foreseen. >When you crypt an image it will be for always.>>* In spite the decrypting phase, performed in game, it's very faster than the crypting process, performed into NG_Center, also the decrypting it will require a bit of time, for this reason it's better using for cryptic images also the IF_PRELOAD flag, in this way the decrypting phase it will happen at the launch of the game, while in game, when the image will be triggered, it will have been already decrypted, and therefore it will be showed fastly.

IF_EFFECT_CROSS_FADE:$8000 ;Used in Image= command.>The cross fade is when there is a fade out (the screen from normal color becomes black) followed by a fade in (the screen from black comes back to normal light.>The image will be displayed in the black phase.>Note: you cann't mix the effect with other effect like zoom or moving from  sides. >Neither the transparent flag works fine with cross fade, since when the image will be displayed the tomb raider screen will be black.>The cross fade works only with overlapped images, not with pop up images.

SPL_LEFT_IMAGE_RIGHT_INFO:1  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>In this layout the image is in top-left side while the info frame is at right of image, i.e. in top-right side.>Hence, the list of savegame will be in bottom half of screen.

SPL_LEFT_IMAGE_BOTTOM_INFO:2 ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>In this layout the image is top left corner, while the info frame is belove the image. The savegame list will be in right half of screen.

SPL_LEFT_IMAGE_NO_INFO:3  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>This layout ha no info frame. The image will be in top left corner while savegame list will be in bottom half of screen. >Remark: with this layout in top-right corner will remain an "empty zone, where you could place (in background image) some logo of your adventure.

SPL_RIGHT_IMAGE_LEFT_INFO:4 ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>In this layout the image will be in top-right corner, the info frame at left of image and the savegame list in bottom half of screen.

SPL_RIGHT_IMAGE_BOTTOM_INFO:5 ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>In this layout the image is top right corner, the info frame will be under the image and savegame list will in left side of screen.

SPL_RIGHT_IMAGE_NO_INFO:6  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>In this layout the image is in top-right corner, there is no info frame and the savegame list will be in bottom half of screen.>Remark: since in this layout the top-left corner will reamain empty you could insert in this space a logo of your adventure drawing it directly in background image.

SPL_CENTRAL_IMAGE:7  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>In this layout the image is at center of top half of screen. The image will be a bit wider than other layout formats, so this layout gives more scene to image and works fine in wide screen mode. >The savegame list will be showed in bottom half of screen.

SPF_NO_TIME_IN_LIST:$0001  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>By default in the savegame list will be showed the savegame with (old) format:>>002  Name of Level       1 days  02:41:11>>The game time is 1 days  02:41:11 part. If you use the SPF_NO_TIME_IN_LIST flag the game will be omitted and for this reason the width required to host savegame list will be less.>You could use this flag when the layout requires savegame list in left (or right) half of screen.

SPF_SCROLL_PAGE:$0002  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>When the savegame list shows only a part of total managable savegames, the player will be able to scroll the saveame to see next hidden save.>By default trng will do scrolling a single savegame at once with DOWN input, but if you wish show a block of savegames in same time you can use this option.

SPF_BLINK_SELECTED:$0004  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>By default the selected savegame in the list will be highlighted with a constant inversion of colors. If you want have a blink of this highlighting you can use the SPF_BLINK_SELECTED flag.

SPF_NO_PANEL_TITLE:$0008   ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>By default in central position of first row trng will draw the title of panel savegame: Load Game or Save Game.>If you want omit this text you can use this flag.>The only reason to omit the title of panel is when you want type some title directly in the background image.>Anyway remember that in this way you cannt handle the difference between Load and Save game.

SPF_PRELOAD_BKG_IMAGE:$0010  ;Used in SavegamePanel= script command.>By default, trng will load and show the background image of savegame panel when the player requires the save/load panel. >Since the operation to load from disk could require a short time in game could be a delay. To avoid this dealy you can add the SPF_PRELOAD_BKG_IMAGE flag and trng will load in memory the background image in advance, when the level was loading, and preserves it in memory to show fastly when it will be necessary.>>Remark: the only reason to omit this flag is when you have a lot of preloaded images in same level, or when you detect a bug about preloaded background image. In very seldom cirucstances the preloaded image of saveame panel could appear damaged. This problem disappears exiting and entering newly in game but it's probably this problem happens own when there is a preloaded image and it occurs some circustance that damages the memory where the image has been stored.

DGX_LARA:$0001  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>Show in diagnostic the info about Lara: coordinates, orienting, room, flags

DGX_ANIMATION:$0002  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>Show the debug data about Animation script command.>An Animation command works in debug mode when you type as animation number a negative number. In this situation the diagnostic will show if the conditions to enable the animation are corrects, and when this is true it will be showed "YES", while in opposite case "no".

DGX_SFX_SOUNDS:$0004  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>It enables the viewing on screen of current sound sample played and infos about further missing sound sample.

DGX_FAR_VIEW:$0008  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>This flag enables the viewing of current world far view distance applied in game.>Remark: this info requires also to have in current level a Turbo script command using adaptive far view, otherwise it will be no showed.

You can find this utility in trle\Tools folder.>This diagnostic mode pratically enables a debug mode about GlobalTrigger, Organizer and TriggerGroup commands, showing all further variables changed by above commands.>It's advisable works with tomb raider in windowed mode to have the chance to see immediatly the tomb4_log window with last mexages. Anyway it's not required, you can also consult the full log at end of tomb4 running, using the command of tomb4_log program [Show/Last tomb.log]>>Tips & Tricks:>1) You can add in Extra field of DiagnosticType comamnd the constant EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG to reduce the quantity of mexages in the log.>See the description of EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG constant for more infos.>>2) You can use function Key F9 to suspend/resume the log about script comamands. You could use this feature to suspend temporary the log when lara is yet very far from the "zone" you wish check, and then reumse the log when you are ready. This trick is useful to reduce the size of log file and get more easy find the correct portion of log you are interested.>>3) The debug mode of script could slow down the game, so remember to disable it when you want play normally.

DGX_WEAPON_ANIMATION:$1000  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>Adding this flag you'll have on screen the infos about current weapon animation.>The animations and state id for weapon management are not visible in lara's infos because the weapon works on specific slots like SHOTGUN_ANIM, GRENADE_GUN_ANIM ecc.

DGX_ADJUSTMENT_MODE:$2000   ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>This DGX_ADJUSTMENT_MODE allows to you, to align some trng objects like Detector and Keypad to have correct coupling between object and text.>In some circustances, when the game screen has a resolution very high, it could born some misplacing between object and text or, for radar detector, the sprites of detected targets.>You should use this adjustment when you discovered some misalignemtn with a resolution higher than those already adjusted by Paolone.>>It's better, in adjusting phase, let enabled only the DGX_ADJUSTMENT_MODE, so you should type following command in [Option] section of script file:>>Diagnostic = ENABLED>DiagnosticType= DGX_ADJUSTMENT_MODE, 0>>In game you'll see printed on screen many variables about position and text formatting of trng objects.>>Keyboard commands in adjustment mode>------------------------------------>To choose the variable to change you use the:  [R] and [F] keys>To change the value of current selected variable use the keys: [Y] and [U] keys>Another keyboard command in adjustment mode is the [S] key. If you had launched the TOMB4_log utility (you find it in "tools" subfolder of trle folder), when you press [S] all current variables and values will be printed in log file.>You should always perform this operation at end of adjustment phase.>To locate in the log file the correct data, look for "ADJUSTMENT DATA" text, and copy and paste (to send to me ) all text between "adjustment data" and "end adjustment" in the last instance, for example:>>   6985:   --------- ADJUSTMENT DATA (640 x 480) --------->   6985:   RADAR DETECTOR:>   6985:   TargetX=1587>   6985:   TargetY=13669>   6985:   SizeTextX=128.00>   6985:   SizeTextY=170.67>   6985:   VLineX=2624>   6985:   VLineY=13715>   6985:   GapX=112>   6985:   GapY=149.33>   6985:   TextX=736>   6985:   TextY=15541>   6985:   COMPASS DETECTOR:>   6985:   VLineY=13845>   6985:   KEYPAD:>   6985:   OrgX=11056>   6985:   OrgY=17685>   6985:   TextY=2304>   6985:   --------- END ADJUSTMENT ---------->>Remember to enclose alwayas also first line because I need to know the resolution used in game during your adjustment.>>Remarks:>>* The adjustment mode allows only temporary to fix the problem, at next game restart the values will come back to original (bad) values.>The adjustemtn should be done with the final target to send the correct adjusted value to me (Paolone) and I'll insert this new best values in next version of trng dll.>The reason that I've not performed myself this job is because to have a correct adjustment it's necessary set the game resolution to some high value but I can reach only 1024 x 768 pixles with my notebook and only a bit better (1280 x 1024) with my desktop.>>So, if you have a most powerfull computer with an higher resolution you can create adjusted values for these extra reolutions those I cann't reach with my current hardware.>>* In radar detector section you could change a lot of value but, pratically, it's advisable change only these three values:>>TargetY  (Set the y position of detected objects on the main (planar) panel)>VLineY (Set the y position of detected objects on the secondary (vertical) panel)>TextY  (Set the y position of text (distance XX meters))

DGX_FPS:$4000 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>Show the current FPS (frame per second).>Note: it will be showed a couple of value: the first is the async frame rate while the second (in round parenthesis) is the sync frame rate.>Usually these two fps variales will have (about) the same value but if you use the Turbo script command with the TRB_ASYNC_FRAMES setting, the async frame might be higher than sync frame since the turbo command will try to compensate the lost of syncronous frame increasing the speed of new frame to recovery the previous losing.

DGX_ERRORS:$8000 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>By default the trng engine is able to give many error messages when it detects some problem with script commands, wrong indices of moveables (in some trigger) and other directx stuff.>Unfortuntaley the most of level designers ignore them because to see these messages they should launch the tomb4_log.exe program (in the "tools" subfolder of trle) and then, at end of the game, show the log that has been caught from the logger.>Perhaps it's a bit boring this procedure, anyway now you can in easier way having the error messages showed on game display in real time if you add the DGX_ERRORS flag to the DiagnosticType command.>>Note: since in the game session the errors could be so much to cover all the screen, trng uses a buffering method: it will keep on the screen an error messages only for five seconds, and more, it will ignore when a new error message is the same it had already printed on the screen in the past.>>At end of the game, you'll find also a text file named "error_parsing_log.txt" in the trle folder, with all error messages.>>If, at end of the playing, you don't find any "error_parsing_log.txt" file this means there have been no errors, of course.>>Remark: some error messages could be very long. To remain all in the screen you should use very little font.>Anyway in the error_parsing_log file you'll fine all errors with no truncation.

EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG:$0001  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>You can add this flag in Extra field of DiagnosticType command to create a shorter debugging log.>When you omit this flag the log will be very large, with a lot of mexages about false conditions, frame for frame. >If you find too chaotic this full log you can create a concise log with EDGX_CONCISE_SCRIPT_LOG flag.


EDGX_SLOW_MOTION:$0002  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>You can use this flag with any combination of DGX_ diagnostic type.>When you enable the slow motion you can slow down the frame rate in game using the F11 key like switch.>Press F11 first time to enable the slow-motion.>If you wish have an extreme slow motion just press different time the F11 key.>To disable the slow-motion you have to hit ESCape key.>>The slow motion is useful when you are studying some custom animation or other dynamic movements and you wish have all details about this action.

EDGX_SWAP_VIEW:$0004 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>With this flag you enable a change of view when you press the F12 key.>The view is about the direction from that Lara will be looked.>This feature is useful when you wish study some animation or mesh of Lara but this is not visible from back view.

EDGX_LARA_CORD_IN_LOG:$0008 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>This extra flag works only when you enabled the DGX_LARA to have Lara's data (animations, stateids) on screen.>If you add the EDGX_LARA_CORD_IN_LOG in ExtraDgxFlas of DiangosticType command, in the log will be showed the coordinates of Lara, too.>>Note: by default the coordinates were missing in the log to reduce its size.

EDGX_TRIGGER_TIMING:$0010 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>The trigger timing will show on screen the distance in frame ticks between a trigger activation and the following.>This could be useful to syncronize better cutscenes with organizer in the script.>Another interesting usage is to convert old method of rolling ball (to enable other trigger in sequence) with an organizer.>Organizer will reduce the used triggers on the map, moving them to the script.>The time you'll see on screen will be only the tick frames elapsed by last trigger activation.

EDGX_RECORDING_DEMO:$0020  ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>This flag enables in game the demo recorder.>You can read the available keyboard commands on the screen, anyway it's better if you read following notes and hints.>>- The max durate for recording is about 25 minutes. If you reach this limit the recording will be stopped byself.>>- In first row of Recorder there will be the name of demo#.pak file currently active. If this name has a # sign in front, it means that this demo#.pak file exists really on disk.>You should take care that when you enable the recording with a demo file with the # sign in front, you are going to overwrite it.>>- You can change the current demo#.pak file active, using the keys "Q" and "W".>With "Q" you reduce by 1 the current Demo index, while with "W" you increase this index.>Valid range is between 1/999>>- Editing of demo files includes a simple backup method. Everytime you erase current demo.pak, using the "e" (erase) command, trng will rename current demo#.pak name as demo#.backup file. In this way the demo#.pak is no more present (erased) but its previous content will be saved in corresponding demo#.backup file. >A backup file will be created also when you begin a new (fresh) recording while it was selected an already existing demo#.pak file.>If you wish restore the backup file and to do became it the main demo.pak file (cancelling last erase/recording overwrite operation) you can use the "r" (restore) command.>>- In the demo editing infos on screen you can see also the indices of currently selected Leading actor ("L-actor) or Extra Actor ("E-actor").>If you don't see above descriptions it means that you have not assigned a role for that (missing) actor role.>>- If you added to the script and organizer linked with the demo you are recording or playing, it will be performed also in editing mode. Anyway you can disable it (but only in editing mode) with F4 key.>>- At start, the game will move on higher free demo index. This means you can record a new demo file avoiding overwritting.>If you wish play some demo file from disk, you can use Q/W keys to choose the demo file and then hit F10 key.>If when you choose an existing demo file (you discover this because it has the # sign in front of demo name), but the info about "F10 to play the demo" is missing, this means that demo has not been recorded in current level and for this reason it's neither possible playing it in current level.>>- When you are playing a demo file, you can stop hit with Escape key or trimming it with F11 or F12 keys.>>While Escape stops only the playing with no change on current demo, the f11 key will remove the part from the begin of the demo until now (when you hit F11 key), while the F12 key will stop the play and also it will truncate the demo at the moment when you hit F12 key. >Therefor you can use F11 and F12 key (on playing) to edit a demo file, removing beginning or ending part from it.>>Note: if the Escape command doesn't work, it happens because you typed a Demo script command in same level section where you are playing the demo.pak file, and in the demo= script command is missing the DEMF_QUIT_WITH_ESCAPE flag.>While you are yet editing demo.pak files in game, it's better add that flag to demo script command, or remove temporary the demo script command from the script with a semicolon ";" character.>>- While playing is in progress you can pause the playing, freezing the game keeping down the F8 key.>This is useful to read the current frame number. Then you can use this info with a demo organizer or to set a condition C86 or C87 to perform some trigger only when demo is playing exactly that frame to have a better syncronization for special effects.>Note: everytime you hit F8 key to stop demo, the number of that frame will be saved to a log file "cutscene_log.txt" in trle folder. In this way you can stop in different moment and then read all stop-point frames.>>Note: about the choice to use C86/87 conditions on the path of lara, or to use a demo organizer (an organizer with the FO_DEMO_ORGANIZER flag) syncronized with the demo, it depends by the number of trigger to perform in the progress of the demo. If you have only one or two triggers its more easy using C86/87 condition. While when the triggers are much more its better using a demo organizer.>>- The F9 key allows the so called "Add recording" operation. >With this operation you continue the recording of current demo, after a previous recording or playing phase.>Note that is not always possible having the add recording: if you have just selected (with q/w keys) a demo, the add recording will be not possibile until you don't play current demo, in fact, it's necessary that lara was in the final position of current demo to continue the recording from final position of it.>If you wish replace the second part of a demo with a new recording (with f9 key), you have to play the demo and then stop it with f12 or escape key. After this command, the following f9 key will add a recording after the previous stop point, overwritting the (previous) final part.>>Note: the add recording operation maybe useful in two circustances:>* When you had recorded a long and complicated demo and you wish preserve first part but, in same time, replace the final part to correct something of it.>* When you wish add many special effects to your cutscene/demo but you need to know the position of frame where set these trigger before continuing. In this case you'll record a part of the demo, then discover the frame where add a trigger, then repeat the demo, and at end, with f9 key you'll continue the recording having the trigger already placed to be able to interact with new game scene changed by above trigger.>>Remark: when you stop a demo with the project of continue the recording in a second moment, you should choose a stop point where lara is still, otherwise the final demo playing will have problems of synchronization. >For instance you can not stop a recording while lara  is falling down in the empty, because when you stop del demo, lara will continue to fall down anyway, and when you'll add the recording the position of lara will be no the real final position of previous part of recording.>Alike speech when lara is running or performing other actions that she will continue to do for a bit, when you stop the playing.>>- Remember that not always the playing of the demo just recorded can works fine. It happens when in the recording phase, lara changed some items in the game that will be different (missing/killed, moved, already enabled ect) for this reason, in following playing. >For instance if lara, in recording phase, enables an enemy and then she kills him, when you perform the play the enemy will be missing, since he has already been enabled and kiled.>To avoid this problem it's better saving the game before beginning a recording, in this way when you wish play the demo just reloading the savegame to come back to previous game situation and then hit F10 key to play the demo from same initial status.>>- Another situation where the playing could be different than recording is when lara interacts with enemies. Since there are some random actions in some enemies, these different movement could affect the behavior of lara (when she is aiming the enemy) or when an enemy touches lara, moving (or turning) a bit her.>For this reason the more sure demos are those where lara has no enemy to aim and no enemies that touches her.>>- The demo files will be saved/loaded from Data folder. In data folder you can also find a DemoInfos.txt file with a descriptive list of demo#.pak files stored in Data folder.>>- There are some limitations about beginning position of lara at moment of recording. >Lara cann't be hanged on rope (and probably, pole-rope), and neither to be driving a vehicle.>It's not possible begin the recording from inventory or other "paused" screen.>Anyway, in spite of these limitation, you can to do to lara all above actions but only in the middle of the recording.>This means you can begin with lara in stand-up position and then move her to hang on pole-rope, or drive the jeep, or enter in inventory to choose an item ect.>Theorically it should be possible beginning a recording while lara is standing-up, climbing, monkeying, running, jumping, shooting, falling, floating on water or swimming underwater.>Differently, it may be problematic beginning with lara is walking (SHIFT+Arrows) because the mode to detect down/release of shift key is very particular and beginning with shift key down it will take weird troubles.>>- About middle phase of recording you should avoid only to load savegames since a demo should work only within a level environment. >>- The demo recorder is able to record only the standard game commands, those you can see in Option/Control Configuration screen, plus the digits between 0-9.>For this reason if you use custom scancode to perform special animation or other new features, these will be not recorded and then played.>  >You have also to use Action (CTRL) key to convalidate the numbers and not the [Enter/Return] key.>>- Expiration of a demo file.>Probably you'll record the demos on final version of your levels, anyway in the case you changed something after having recorded a demo, you have to learn when these changes could get troubles for demo playing.>>*You should avoid the change of equipment of inventory items when in the demo lara choose some item from inventory, because with some missing or more item, the movement to select correct item could change. In this situation a trick could be to record the demo when the selected item (first item selected in inventory) is own that lara will choose. In this way it will work also adding or removing items from inventory.>>*It may be dangerous change lara object in wad file, adding or removing animations, frames or meshes.>>*Do not change geometry of room where lara will move in the demo, of course, anyway it's not serious if you add new rooms or change textures, triggers, sounds or other non-collisional stuff.>>- Please, remember the fundamenal improvement of C25 condition trigger: now there is the new mode "Demo/Custscene mode" for this condition>>Thank to this condition you can place trigger (casted with above C25 condition) that will be enabled only in demo mode.>This could be useful to improve your demo/cutscene with many triggers that will be no triggered in common game mode, also if lara will come back in that room where you do pass her in the demo.>Another important benefit is that you can use these triggers (working only in demo mode) to prepare the demo with all correct enemey enabled or door opened or weapon/pickups got, ect.>>For instance...>>If you wish show a demo where lara fights with the final monster of your level (reached after a long path) and she is using a new weapon (that in common game will be get only after picking up many sub-items) you need for your demo to have already lara closed to the monster place, with the special weapon in inventory and with the monster already enabled.>>It's important understand that the demo doesn't save all features of the game but only the lara position+status and her following movements, given from input control.>>So, since (for a demo from title) lara will begin when the level is at start, she (in above example) will have NO special weapon, yet, and she will be very very far from the place with monster. About the distance is not a problem, since if you begin the recording when lara is closed to the montster room, when the demo it will be played, lara will be moved immediatly in that position.>>While to solve other problems, you have to place in the sector where you begin the recording, the (C25 casted) triggers to add in inventory the special weapon and to enable (trigger) the monster. >You'll record only from this sector, closed to the monster, where lara will trigger the adding of special weapon and the monster. >All above triggers will be casted with C25 condition to be enabled ONLY in demo mode. In this way they will not affect the game playing when lara will move over them in common game. >By other hand it's necessary understand that above triggers have to be present also in final release of your level, otherwise the demo will not work. For this reason you cann't simply change temporary your level (adding triggers), to record the demo, and then remove these triggers.>To reconstruct the situation that lara should have in different moment and sides of your level, you have to place and let there, many c25 triggers that will reproduce in fast way equipment and situation that in common playing should require a lot of time to be gotten.>>- Tips and tricks: Adding different view of Lara with fixed camera, flybycamera or maxtrix or potrait effect improve your demo, anyway it's complicate recording the demo and move lara correctly when you have not a normal view of the game. >The trick to solve this problem is simply to add in a second moment the triggers (with c25 condition) to enable different viewing of the game. In this way you'll record (and drive lara) with a common view to avoid errors, while after you completed the recording you place c25+camera trigger in the path of lara in the demo, and in this way in final playing you'll have many suggestive camera views.>>- There is also the new flipeffect (F379) "Cutscene. Perform the demo.pak with [&index] in (E)way" to launch a demo from a [Level] section to do work it like a cutscene.>Also to create cutscene the C25 casted triggers are very important. To change camera view, setting animating with special custom animations, adding texts and new background sound or music, ect. >See above point about C25 condition for more infos.
 
EDGX_CUTSCENE_LOG:$0040 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>You can enable the creation of a log about cutscenes.>The log will be saved in trle folder with name "custscene_log.txt" and it will give infos about:>>- Demo game commands of current demo.pak is playing. The game commands are  like "action", "jump", "left", "right" ect>- Speech commands of currently enabled PARAM_ACTOR_SPEECH script command.>- Organizer commands linked with current demo (only for organizer with FO_DEMO_ORGANIZER flag)

EDGX_ANIMATION_SLOT:$0080 ;Used in DiagnosticType script command.>Adding this flag you can have on screen a signal when the condition for animationslot with negative AnimIndex is true or false.>This flag works in same way of DGX_ANIMATION flag.>You have to type an animationslot command where the AnimIndex field will have a negative value. In this way the animation will be not performed but it will be tested the conditions and when they will be true or false the result will be drawn on screen.


SWT_BASE_ZERO:$0001  ;Used in Switch script command.>By default the Switch command perform the first TriggerGroup of the list, when the PlaceFolderVariabile has value "1", it performs the second when variable = 2, ect.>Differently, if you wish the first value was "0" (to perform first triggergroup of the list) you can use this flag.

SWT_RANDOM_MODE:$0002  ;Used in Switch script command.>If you want introduce random elements in your adventure you can use this flag to perform different triggers in random way.>When you use the SWT_RANDOM_MODE flag, the field VariablePlaceFolder will be ignored, and the number used to select the TriggerGroup to perform will be generated in random way.>For example if you place three triggergroup IDs in the list, when you perform this switch the trng engine will generate a random number in the range (1 - 3) (or 0 - 2 if you use BASE_ZERO flag), and then it will perform the trigger group in according with this random number.

DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE:$0001 ;Used in Demo script command.>Used in [Title] section.>With this flag, when a demo of array will be played, if the following demo is of same level, that will be performed, too, and go on for all demos with same level number.>The advantage to use this flag is to avoid the "load-new-level" phase followed by the "come-back-to-title-level" phase, since all single demos of that level will be played in sequence when their level has already been loaded.

DEMF_PLAY_ALL_SEQUENCE:$0002 ;Used in Demo script command.>Used in [Title] section.>This flag force to perform all demos whom indices are in DemoArray field of Demo= command.>In this case it's no important the level number of single demos, all they will be played when first demo has been triggered.>Since everytime a demo can work only in the level where it had been recorded, it's better in this case, type in the array demo indices contiguous for same level to reduce the number of loading new level phases.

DEMF_QUIT_WITH_ESCAPE:$0004 ;Used in Demo script command.>If you wish allow to player the quitting of a demo while it's playing, you have to add the DEMF_QUIT_WITH_ESCAPE flag to DemoFlags, and when player will press Escape the current playing will be stopped and the controll will come back to the title level (if the demo was in [Title] section) or the controll will come back to player in common game (if the demo was in [Level] section)


DEMF_CROSS_FADE:$0008  ;Used in Demo script command.>By default the first demo will begin with a fade-in (from black to game screen), anyway if you used DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE or DEMF_PLAY_ALL_SEQUENCE, you can add cross fade to swap the two demo while the game screen is black.>If you omit this flag in a demo sequence, lara will disappear from last position of first demo, and she will appear (suddenly) in new room and position of start point of second demo.>The disvantage to use cross fade is that the last frames of first demo and the first frames of following demo, will be darked.

DEMF_RANDOM:$0010  ;Used in Demo script command.>Used in [Title] section.>If you wish that the demos (supposing you had more than a demo binary file) had no fixed order, i.e. the first demo to be played can be different for any game section, you can add the DEMF_RANDOM flag. In this situation has no relevance the order whom you type the Demo IDs in array demo fields, since this order will be changed randomly everytime the game will be launched.>>Note: the DEMF_RANDOM flag doesn't work fine with DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE and DEMF_PLAY_ALL_SEQUENCE flags, since the contiguous same level number you set in the array it will be changed randomly.

DEMF_PLAY_ON_KEY:$0020 ;Used in Demo script command.>Used in [Title] section.>If you wish that the player was able to launch himself the demos, choosing between different demos, you can add the DEMF_PLAY_ON_KEY flag.>In this situation you should also type a textinfo string to explain to the player what keys he can press.>>Note: The keys are always digits, from 1 to 0, where 0 is for 10.>If you created demos in three levels of your adventure, you can use as textinfo string one like this:>"Hit "1","2", or "3" to show demos.">The number of the key is not for the position of Demo Id in arraydemo fields, and neither directly the Demo ID, but it is the level number whom a demo will be played.>If you had more than one demo for that (chosen) level, the choice will depends by the further DEMF_RANDOM or DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE flags.>As general rule, trng will avoid to show twice a demo already shown and it will give the precedence to demos not yet played.

DEMF_PERFORM_AT_START:$0040  ;Used in Demo script command.>Used in [Level] section, (cutscene mode)>If you use a Demo command in a [Level] section, you can add the DEMF_PERFORM_AT_START flag to force trng to play the demo at begin of the level, like a intro cutscene.>Note: if also the DEMF_PLAY_LEVEL_SEQUENCE flag is present, all demos cutscenes will be played in a sequence with no chance for player to interact with the game until last demo has been played.


DEMF_CINEMA_SCREEN:$0100 ;Used in Demo script command.>This flag add the cinema screen effect while the demo is playing.>For cinema effect we mean when two black bars, at top and bottom of the screen, give a wide screen effect. This is alike that  effect you see in the flyby sequence but in this case the black bars are higher to cover the (further) hp bar (otherwise it is only partially covered, bad effect) and to distinguish demo cutscenes respect flyby camera.>>Note: A problem with cinema screen is that top and bottom legend demo will be covered by the black bars. For this reason if you enable cinema screen you should use a vertcal center alignment for demo legend or disable the demo legend text.

DEMF_MUTE_TRACK:$200 ;Used in Demo script command.>You can silent the audio tracks while the demo is playing with this flipeffect.>This flag doesn't affect the sound effects.


DEMF_MUTE_SFX:$400 ;Used in Demo script command.>This flag silent the sound effects but it lets the background music, from Audio folder.>This solution is good when you wish give to the demos a more understated layout, avoiding the shoot or jump sounds but letting the chance to have a soft background music (audio track). In this situation it's interesting playing a different audio track in demo mode to entertain the player/viewer.>>Note: to silent the sound effects trng engine will change (temporarily) the sfx sound volume, setting it to zero. Oddly also with this null volume, the strongest sfx sounds could be listened in light way.

94@Change Version
95@Keep always the window of NG_Center over other windows
96@You can restore an old TRNG configuration choosing the wished version
97@Animation Watcher
98@To look for missing animations or to find animation in other wad. You can also compare two wad files to discover differences about animations
99@Format Sprite Slot
100@If you have some problem to add  many big textures to some SPRITE slot you can use this tool to format an existing sprite slot in your wad file, setting the number of textures and their size
101@Sprite Editor
102@If you have some problem to import/export texture in new sprites using Wad Merger you can use this tool to modify single texture of each sprites in your wad files
103@Icon Replacer
104@You can change the icon of tomb4.exe. It's advisable to use this tool ONLY when you change the TRNG tomb4.exe.  This tool cann't work with other .exe file, if you use it with other exe files you'll damage them
105@NG Font Editor
106@You can import a Windows font in your  FONT_GRAPHICS object  of your wad file. It's necessary you have alreay  copied the FONT_GRAPHICS object  in your wad before editing it. 
107@Convert texts to new format
108@From 1.1.9.8 TombNextGeneation version TRNG supports only the new ANSI character set, this is the normal set used in Windows. You can use this tool to convert the old tomb format in new format for all strings of language files. 
109@Get Screen Frames
110@When you need to compute a frame of screen in Micro Units you can use this little utility. The Micro Units are a proportional unit used by some script command like the Image= script command
111@Change Track Names
112@Now you can have your audio track with long names to describe better their sense. Just the first three characters was a number between 0 - 255. With this tool you can rename your audio track of tomb4 or tomb5 with their original names in automatic way.
113@WMV Encoder
114@Tools to encode AVI video in WMV format. A better way than using internal WMV encoder of some video programs.This tool is a graphic interface for official Windows Media Encoder By Microsoft
115@Object Manager
116@This tool allows to find the image of objects and infos about level where locating it,  In current database there are all objects of standard wads and all tr4 files of The Last Revelation. You can also add new objects in the database if you wish.
117@NG Doctor
118@Your NG Doctor performs an analyse of your trng installation and current project to detect further problems, then it creates a text report with the response. You can solve yourself the problem or to use the report to inform some friend about your installation.
119@Remap Lara Skin
120@If you changed the Lara Skin you need to remap some vertices to be sure that the new Skin worked correctly. You can use this tool to have an automatic remapping of the skin, in the default slot or in other slot for further mesh swapping.
121@Texturize DXF File
122@This tool allows to restore the textured faces in an object exported from StrPix program and changed with MetaSequoia. You have to keep the two different DXF file: the original from strpix and that from MetaSequoia

235@REMARKs:>1) About the mesh names (S6, J11 ect), you should watch the [Reference Table: Skin - Joint] picture.>You can see this image clicking on [Show Reference Image] button>>2) It's normal that there were 5 don't matching vertices for skin meshes: J2, J5, J9 and J12, if you omit the [Ignore Inner vertices] setting.>>3) It's normal get one [DON'T MATCH] for Extra Slot vertex. In my humble opinion it's not necessary perform a remapping of Extra slots for weapons and flare because the method used by engine to swap the lara's hands doesn't require a new skin adaption. Anyway it could be useful a remapping for Lara Scream and Lara speech slots>>4) When you want remap a lara_skin+lara_skin_joint placed in some _mip slot to perform a swap mesh in game, you should take care that, at least the shape and position of new lara_joint's mehses, were exactly the same than default LARA_SKIN_JOINTS slot. This tool is able to modify the vertices of lara_skin and other slots but it cann't change the position of LARA_SKIN_JOINTS mehese and it will take always as reference for best remapping the vertices of default LARA_SKIN_JOINTS slot
