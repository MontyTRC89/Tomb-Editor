HOW TO MAKE INSTALLER:

1. Compile Release build into empty BuildRelease folder (with no stray logs, autosave prj2 etc.)
2. Download NSIS from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/
3. Run NSIS and execute install_script.nsi in-place from Installer folder. It will generate TombEditorInstall.exe installer inside BuildRelease folder.
4. You are ready to deploy your installer!

IN CASE NEW COMPONENTS ARE ADDED AND FILE LIST IN BuildRelease FOLDER IS CHANGED:

1. Download uninstalled files list generator here: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/images/9/9f/Unlist.zip
2. Run it onto clean BuildRelease folder, it will generate new file list block ready to be placed into NSIS script
3. Overwrite autogenerated file list block in install_script.nsi "Uninstall" section (there's comments for that) with new one
4. You are ready to go again!

HOW TO PUBLISH RELEASE USING RELEASES REPO:

1. Clone TombEngine/TombEditorReleases repo.
2. Use these 2 git command line commands (where X.X.X is release version):

git commit --allow-empty -m "Release X.X.X"
git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Version X.X.X"

3. Push to remote.
4. Create new release under new tag in "Releases" section on GitHub website.
5. Upload installer and zip file under new release.
6. Publish.
